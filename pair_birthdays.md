## Pair Problem

It's time to celebrate birthdays by doing some probability--yay!  If you haven't worked through problems like this before, the answers may surprise you.

You should be able to compute analytic answers for each of these, though you will want to eventually use code to arrive at final numbers.  You can ignore leap days for all four questions.

1.  **Birthday Pairings.**  
You are throwing a party and inviting random people you have never met.  What's the fewest number of people you need to invite to have at least 50% probability that two strangers will have the same birthday?  (Birth year need not match.)

1.  **Finding Your Birthmate.**  
*You* want to find someone whose birthday matches yours.  How many strangers do you need to ask to have a 50-50 chance of matching?

1. *(Optional)* **Relating the Birthday Pairings and Birthmate Problems.**  
If *r* people compare birthdays in the pairing problem, the probability is *P_r* that at least 2 have the same birthday.  Letting *n* be the number of strangers you ask in the personal birthmate problem, what should *n* be to make your probabiliy of success approximately *P_r*?

1. **Birthday Holidays.**  
An up-and-coming tech start-up has developed a novel time-off policy:  the CEO gives all the workers a holiday whenever one of them has a birhtday.  Other than these birthday-holidays, they are expected to work 365 days a year.  The CEO wants to maximize the expected number of total man-days worked per year at the company.  How many people should the CEO hire? _(Note: the CEO's birthday is not considered a holiday.)_
