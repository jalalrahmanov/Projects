It is close to the interstate, restaurants, and starbucks while being on a quiet street in a beautiful neighborhood. Shannon is very kind and thoughtful. The apartment had everything you could need. It is big, nicely decorated, furnished, stocked, and has a private entrance. The location is great as well. It is the nicest airbnb I have stayed in so far and it is also very affordably priced. I would definitely stay here again."

229106,32469867,507678610,2019-08-11,6719789,Kenneth,"Katy's place is clean, quiet, and easy to access.  She provided all the amenities you need to make your stay convenient and comfortable. Although we didn't use the common area, there is ample space to relax outside of your private room.  I'm giving her place a 5 star review but a few things to note:

1)  The A/C doesn't really make its way into the upstairs room so it can feel stuffy even with the fan on - we left the door cracked in the evening and it did help - although not as comfortable as I would have liked.  That said, it was unusually warm time of the year for Denver so I would imagine this is generally not an issue?
2) The townhouse is on the corner of the street across from a bar so if you are a light/early sleeper, be prepared for foot traffic and conversation coming from street level.  Didn't bother us, but just make note.

Location is convenient - easy access to many restaurants and bars around."
154052,21069884,425067898,2019-03-17,76429190,Wendi,Great space for a couple.  Seth is a great communicator and there were no surprises.  Highly recommend it!
205338,27455846,562420266,2019-11-10,154244848,Kerry,"This adorable house was perfect for 5 girlfriends coming from 5 different places for a weekend in Denver. The beds were very comfortable, the towels were fresh, fluffy, and plentiful, and we never ran out of hot water! The Hosts were super responsive and accommodating. The house is a short walk to great eating/drinking/shopping options. The kitchen is basic. If we’d wanted to stay in, more comfy seating would’ve made it perfect."
208502,27992799,402815830,2019-01-19,62592241,Manny,"Good location , clean , private Alex was a great host responded quickly and intructions to check in were very clear."
128609,18227184,436246143,2019-04-12,102138907,Roxayne,Super clean & quiet space. Hosts usually responded to any question sent thru app within minutes. Allowed bag drop off prior to check-in and the biggest benefit was a sweetheart of a medium sized dog that loved to snuggle if you wanted her too!
127426,18105941,435211936,2019-04-09,24902933,Veronica,"Tobi's place was awesome! The bed was super comfy, and the room was perfect. Loved hanging with Tobi and the pups they were great company.

Kimberly and Patrick have thought of everything you might need in their comprehensive welcome guide, one of the best I have seen.
The house was perfect for my daughter and I and would easily support two couples visiting the city.
Highly recommended!"
206163,27603607,477138370,2019-06-27,51602849,Tanya,"Wonderful, clean space in an very convenient location if you are traveling via the Denver airport. Thoughtful, high end touches include nice sheets and bedding, extra towels and the best hairdryer I have ever used! We arrived super late due to two delays and left early, so we did not meet our hosts, but we felt very welcome and comfortable!"
76733,12288253,265336527,2018-05-16,58652624,Nicholas,Lauren is great! Had a quick stay and she was lovely to communicate with throughout.
107522,15746223,264438224,2018-05-13,116858902,Kylee,Great little place. Very private and easy access. Nice little outside seating area. Very close to everything you need. We even left the car a few times to walk to Sloan’s lake and downtown is literally a 7min drive. Parking wasn’t bad either. Very clean. A little snug for 3 people but definitely doable. The only thing lacking was amenities like coffee and snacks or drinks but other than that it was great. I would stay here again especially because of the awesome location in Denver. Never did get to officially meet the hosts but we LOVED the privacy. Thanks for making our stay in Denver enjoyable!
209670,28137750,455376457,2019-05-19,18720376,Moe,Super clean and very welcoming space. Quiet and safe neighborhood. It is a great place to land after a long trip and perfect for early flights out!
77627,12492320,522996857,2019-09-02,277483002,Caleb,12/10 on the rating. You can’t beat this location nor the price. David was awesome with communication and also gave us great food and location references. I will 100% go through David again the next time I find myself in Denver. Place was clean & nice - also had a very nice kitchen along with a back patio for privacy. I was very satisfied with my stay here & know I will find myself here again - Thanks again David!

It is clean, spacious, and they have stocked and thought of EVERYTHING your family might need while there. It was easy to communicate and get a response from the host, Erik. It is a great location, easy to Uber cheaply to any part of Denver. Truly enjoyed our stay and look forward to many more Denver adventures! Would totally recommend staying here!"

It was the perfect place for us."
179515,23616466,352726963,2018-11-25,105879197,Michelle,We loved this property for our large family!!  The layout of the house was great including the open kitchen/living room area as well as the large dining space.  Adorable patio space too!!  We had so much fun playing ping-pong!!  There were plenty of towels and kitchen items available.  The hosts were super responsive and very friendly.  The location gave us easy access to major roads.  We thoroughly enjoyed our time here!!  Thank you again!!
10941,1327856,57521432,2015-12-27,46718087,Heather,"Leila & Alex left great instructions for us even though we never met face to face.  The apartment was comfortable for our holiday gathering.  I thought there were 3 bedrooms by the photos, but since our son lived fairly close he ended up going back to his place at night instead of staying with us.  The kitchen was fully equipped and we enjoyed cooking a majority of our meals there. Otherwise we found restaurants conveniently located in the neighborhood."
1051,39405,4297376,2013-04-25,2307828,Sarah,"My sister and I stayed in Jennifer and Giovanni's Mulberry Cottage and really enjoyed our stay. Jennifer and Giovanni where very hospitable and friendly and the home, though not large, was comfortable and cozy. The location is ideal and is right around the corner from my favorite coffee spot in the area, Black Eye. Also, the grounds/yard are lovely and are perfect if you like to enjoy coffee/wine in a serene and peaceful outdoor setting. Thank you again Jennifer and Giovanni! "

It was my first time to Denver and my stay at the wee little house definitely made it a very pleasant trip. "
146315,20441430,459618378,2019-05-27,259473286,Jordan,"John was a great Host! I’m a bit on the younger side so I was enjoying the city life pretty late into the morning. Their were no issues with coming in at 2am-5am. Everything was clean, he was friendly, and I had everything I needed after a very long night of having fun! Would highly recommend to anyone."
86087,13449331,99996788,2016-09-06,32161378,Ashley,"Gary's place was great! It was super clean, quiet, and had a lot of little amenities that made it extra special!  Gary was really communicative, checking in a few times to make sure everything was perfect. Thanks so much for making the weekend even better with a great space and host! Awesome 1st time experience!"

181604,23801735,546581323,2019-10-13,28349806,Jeffrey,"This house served it's purpose for a group of 10 friends visiting Colorado for a Wedding.  It is a huge space with plenty of common rooms in addition to the 5-private bedrooms.  Steven was quick to respond to us and we were able to use the house, garage and yard without any issues.  The ""6th bedroom""  is a pull out couch in a sitting room off the kitchen but that didn't affect our stay.  The house is clearly a rental and is showing some signs of wear and tear but again nothing that affected our time there.  We would stay again."
7385,833937,25652970,2015-01-22,22624794,Byron,"This was a perfect little house, great location, and great amenities. Nothing beats having an amazing record collection to browse through! Bus and rail station are a shirt walk away and open you up to get to the downtown core in 10-15min. Overall this property was all we wanted and more!"

20166,3412478,47101204,2015-09-15,41076780,Sophia,"Both Brandy and I were in and out quite a bit during my stay there, but she did make me feel very welcome and was extremely responsive to any questions I had by texting. I pretty much had the place to myself when I was there, it's very cozy and clean. The area is great, I felt very safe. I rented a car so I can't vouch for public transportation, but the city Center was about a 10 minute drive away and there are plenty of great food options within walking distance (or delivery). Her cats are the sweetest things ever!"
231396,33251110,484342922,2019-07-08,107409535,Lindsay,Good place and it was easy to get around   It is not far from the airport either. The hosts were friendly and nice...their dog is adorable too.

34279,5402378,321009502,2018-09-09,56494486,Brittany,Just as described. House had everything we needed and is in a great location. Awesome back yard and the hot tub was great. Hosts are extremely responsive and helpful. I’d definitely stay here again!

Their customer service is superb! The apartment was extremely clean, plenty of towels/basic supplies. AMAZING location! So close to a strip of bars/restauraunts, sushi directly next door, Liqour store across the street, and Coors field was a block away. All at an amazig price! 100% will be booking this Air b&b next time I am in Denver."

We got into Nicks home and went straight to bed. The house is located in the basement which has been remodeled into a beautiful home. It slept all 5 of us comfortably. There is a huge beanbag that my sister loved sleeping on. Overall I would recommend Nick home if your ever in the Denver area!"
206852,27734054,409747700,2019-02-08,13506468,Terri,"I am back at my home away from home, and it gets better every time! There were some thoughtful touches like magazines, yogurt, and even a bottle of wine welcoming me back. Richard has been an incredible host, and very accommodating when I had to extend my trip by a week! He had the place cleaned on the last day of my first reservation so I have fresh towels and linens. Above and Beyond what I expected. Thank you Richard and Candace!"

73964,11713844,122723145,2016-12-25,10453361,Nancy,"Jessica's place was a perfect location for us, just a few blocks away from my daughter.  We gathered for the holidays at this house, as her studio apartment wouldn't hold us all.  The dining area was great for 5-6 of us to have meals; the living area was comfortable with great access to internet/TV options.  The 2 bedrooms, kitchen, and bathroom were very ""cozy"" (seemed a bit smaller than the photos).  Only 3  of us stayed at this house, which was very comfortable.   If you have 6,  I would suggest that you be very good friends or close family!   Privacy is limited.  
The house is very cute and clean, with many convenient touches.     The appliances are older, but all worked well.   The kitchen is small, but has a great supply of dishes, utensils, etc.   Parking is as described - not that big of an issue - you may need to walk a bit but it was always less than a block.  The information provided on site was fantastic - how to work everything and where everything is.  We had a great stay at a great value, and I can easily recommend this house for your next stay!   "
194483,25477727,477652242,2019-06-28,42956696,Amanda,"Great place to stay in Denver - nice building, beautiful views! Andrew and Rebecca were helpful and responsive. I'd stay again!"

148241,20680884,289162392,2018-07-11,174628398,Corey,This apartment is amazing. It’s located in the  heart of everything Denver and very close to downtown. I loved everything from the real wood floors to the personal touches. Decorated with personality. This apartment is part of a historic era building and the originality alone is worth a look.
68499,10494162,414124448,2019-02-18,227499415,Vanessa,The guest house is cozy and adorable. It was the perfect “home base” for us to come home to after a few days exploring Denver and the Rockies. I highly recommend!
90320,13751968,275727573,2018-06-11,19039449,James,"This place was very cute and accurately described. There is no central air, just a mobile cooling unit. We didn't know how to use it until our second night. You have to fill it up with water and put ice in the top for it to properly cool down the apartment.  Once we figured this out our stay was very comfortable!"

The unit was super comfy and clean - the bed was amazing after such a long journey to get to Denver. Check in was easy, even at 3 am!"

79986,12915068,82763570,2016-06-29,262964,Peter & Nicole,"I have stayed at numerous Airbnb locations around the US and in South America. I rate my stay at Country Club North as among the very best! I was met by Dave (Leanne was out of town), was warmly welcomed and given a tour of where I would be staying. The house is in a very nice neighborhood, quiet and with parking right in front. The room and home were very clean, very comfortable bed, nice bathroom, plenty of towels, etc. I had the whole basement level to myself, even use of the washer and dryer. I highly recommend staying at Dave and Leanne's location!"
161122,21662868,539585762,2019-10-01,26888571,Julia,"A very comfortable stay for a lay over but I didn't have transport and found the taxi fare to get there a bit high. I didn't know the area, so my fault"
54413,8566977,113255475,2016-11-11,5082943,Marissa,"The apartment was exactly as described and had lots of thoughtful touches - lamps beside the bed, emergency torches in the switches, night light in the bathroom and a great coffee machine. The whole place was immaculately clean and made for a very pleasant stay. One of our party commented that he felt like he was staying at a friend's house. Highly recommend it. "

223843,31261351,547141197,2019-10-14,12186864,Carlos,"This house was amazing! So many different rooms and a lot of closet space. The backyard was perfect enough for all 11 of my buddies to sit and relax or shoot some cornhole. Just a 10 min walk or 5 min uber ride to coffee shops, voodoo doughnut, Denver biscuit company and a bunch of other places to eat. If you have any questions, they will get back to you quickly with an answer. Check in was at 4, but I asked if we could check in earlier, being that we landed around 11:30am and they quickly responded with a yes! That of course was because they had the house cleaned by than so maybe we just got lucky. Everyone who walked through the door said ""this place is so neat! "" Great, fun mansion to stay in while visiting Denver. Highly recommend! Thank you for a great experience!"
34582,5433111,422653329,2019-03-11,50227379,Ben,A great one bedroom (two BR with a pullout couch) space within walking distance to a lot of restaurants and breweries.  Todd's place was clean and even had gated off-street parking!  Perfect for what we needed.

240327,36600928,528261508,2019-09-12,23350529,Lauren,"Angelina is a fantastic host! She was incredibly accommodating to my schedule (I arrived very late at night), and flexible when I decided to extend my stay. The space is sparkling clean, can easily host a small family, and is complete with fresh linens and new carpeting. If you're interested in staying near Wash Park and don't mind being in a basement (I found it cozy, not cramped), then I would highly recommend this home. Plus you really can't beat the location. Enjoy!"
123062,17341684,188519034,2017-08-29,30383519,Carmina,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Alex has a lovely home and him and his poodle Mason were great hosts. 

The room was very comfy and spacious with easy access to the bathroom and laundry. It's also perfectly located in central Denver.  

Our sometimes hyperactive corgi definitely enjoyed her stay as much as we did."

44508,7238579,97480869,2016-08-27,19640747,Lily,April's place was comfy and perfect for a quick stay.  I mostly just needed a place to sleep at the end of along day in an unfamiliar town.  Everything was clean and nice and April is hospitable a host as can be.

32823,5070640,36810041,2015-07-01,22863392,Tyler,"Andrea did a great job of describing the place, and was so accommodating. The house is in the middle of a great neighborhood w/a great community feel w/plenty of shops and great places to eat. Everything was exactly as described. The only thing I will say is it got a little warm in the carriage house during the day (I get hot VERY easily though), but our stay was during some uncharacteristically hot weather. The main bed was very comfy and the pull out sofa was surprisingly comfy as well, and was great to lay down and watch some TV w/the kids. Great Place. Great neighborhood. Great host. Thanks Airbnb and THANKS ANDREA!!!"
5356,665622,155212293,2017-05-27,105519356,Leela,"Great location, easy to take an Uber or Lyft right downtown. The place itself was clean and nicely decorated. We had everything we need and felt right at home. We also appreciated the ease of check-in and good communication."

98132,14759489,113266645,2016-11-11,6448004,Christina,"The accommodations were extremely nice. We utilized the basement area, which offered great privacy. Cozy and quiet. Location was easy to find. We had access to the kitchen and washer/dryer. Uber and Lyft access was quick and only a short distance from everything downtown. ($6-12 rides). Darren was very responsive and more than accommodating.  

Everything was exactly as described! Thank you!!!"
143528,20033468,408808579,2019-02-05,46504017,Tim,What a STEAL! Totally awesome location and super easy check in. The way to go if you’re in Denver! Would book again
24827,3992779,75168242,2016-05-19,63773875,Margaret,"Elizabeth was an excellent host - everything in the apartment is as described in the listing. Elizabeth was so sweet and welcoming and even left us some coffee and great tasting beer! Her guidebook provided excellent recommendations too. Her place was centrally located, and within walking distance or a short Uber ride to many places in Denver. Her place is perfect for two people and I would definitely recommended staying at her place! Plus, her dogs are adorable :)"
45130,7359477,83125191,2016-07-01,15025476,Joe,Tess was excellent in communicating. We had one little issue and she immediately fixed it. The location is perfect if you are going to a Broncos game or other event at the football stadium. A good option for staying in Denver. 
32676,4978830,559110374,2019-11-03,211510804,Franchesca,A very nice house & clean stay! It was very spacious for our group! We loved that they had menus for near by places to deliver food!

Good location and walking distance from many dining options."
10397,1189999,20096843,2014-09-23,19913289,Tami,"My daughter, son and I had a wonderful stay in Mike's apartment. As soon as we walked in we knew we made the right choice. It was very clean, comfortable and in a great location. We were able to walk to great dining and shopping and was an easy drive to downtown Denver. One of the highlights staying at Mike's place was getting up in the morning and having coffee in the peace of the back yard. The apartment was of good size and even though there were only 3 of us it would easily accommodate 4 if not more. 
Mike was always very quick to respond with any questions or concerns I had. 
I would highly recommend Mike's apartment to any one visiting Denver."
116322,16589595,216924604,2017-12-06,1904752,Kelly,"Definitely a great value for the price!! Super clean and my favorite part was the fireplace!

43365,7071425,63646596,2016-02-25,57899596,Jenny,"McKenzie was very helpful and answered any question in a timely manner. There was an issue with the cable and as soon as she realized it was beyond her control she sent for a cable company service call. 
The room was incredibly clean and neat. The décor was very modern and quaint. There was some construction going on during the day right next door but they didn't start until after 8 am and were done around 5 pm. We would definitely stay again!"
17908,2653512,556075679,2019-10-28,8293432,Briar,"This is the Air B&B you want to stay at when in Denver! It has everything you could possibly need, is in a great location and Marcie and Damon are fantastic hosts who happily share their local knowledge. We will be recommending it to anyone we know heading to Denver."
7952,852934,423610777,2019-03-14,244229034,Aishwarya,"Very close to the downtown of Denver, ambience was amazing, the house has its own special touch of uniqueness by the hosts. The response from the hosts were quick and we had an excellent time staying there."
41978,6869896,87090357,2016-07-18,33308926,Cameron,"Hosts- Billy and Julie were extremely kind, accommodating. Julie met us at check-in and gave us a lot of great advice on things to check out around town. They also have a categorized booklet of their favorite restaurants which we found very useful. 

House- The home is extremely comfortable, and tastefully decorated. The location is fantastic, as there are plenty of walkable restaurants, bars, parks, stores, etc. It had everything we needed and more. Highly recommend! "
198188,26165764,417310653,2019-02-26,151317941,Joyce,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay - Katia and her husband were so helpful even though we didn’t get a chance to cross paths in person!

Loved the little extras in the kitchenette area - The mini fridge and small freezer came in handy, the granola bars, oatmeal, bowls, ziplocks etc too!

Their place was super convenient to get to the airport this morning (10 min to hertz drop off) as well as site see around Denver. Should we return to Denver without the kids we’ll definitely be back."
85152,13380198,502411869,2019-08-04,44189225,Martha,"This is a great house for a big group. We hosted a family reunion and it was perfect. The open floor plan and big, well equipped kitchen allows everyone to be together in a comfortable space. 
Yoann is very responsive and the location is great."

55010,8671797,294137855,2018-07-21,24522133,Jonathan,great stylish garage apartment with all of the amenities you would need and close to downtown
180028,23642743,406182980,2019-01-28,100664037,Alyson,"If you are looking for a safe and (mostly) quiet place to rest your head, this is a GREAT option! 
Close to many area attractions, restaurants, bars and dispensaries, this place is idea for travellers who don't plan on spending a great deal in the room. Its an awesome spot if you just need a place to lay your hed between activities. Because the host stays in the house above, I WOULD NOT suggest this place if you are sensitive to people walking and talking above you or if you are looking for a quiet place. 
This place has everything you need for a quick weekend trip or adventure home base. 
There are many transportation options nearby; Lyft rides were available 24 hours/day, bus and other transit lines were a short walk away. The train station was only a mile or so away, so getting to and from the airport was a simple process. 

The host was super attentive and friendly. I'd DEF SUGGEST this place for weekend Denver visitors."
177505,23378643,243378453,2018-03-15,21964769,Samantha,We had a great stay at James’s house! It really felt like our home away from home and was a perfect home base for exploring all that Denver has to offer. I would absolutely recommend this place for a comfortable and laid back residence!

12212,1733052,9980523,2014-01-22,10489930,Davis,"This is a great place to stay: central location, comfortable accommodations, and friendly hosts.  It's a basement unit that consists mainly of two rooms. It's got a big living room with a large television and sofa, a mini fridge and bar sink, and a lil twin bed tucked away in the corner. It's also got a nice, soft bed in a separate bedroom, a big ole bathroom w/ a large bathtub, and a lil utility closet with a washer and dryer. Parking can get a little dicey on the weekends, but I always ended up finding a spot less than a block away. Stay here- you won't regret it!  "

We walked several times to the RiNo area where there are lots of restaurants, breweries, and bars. It’s a bit of a long walk but perfect for beautiful summer evenings in Denver. We found the location convenient for getting on the highway to go out to the mountains and for taking Lyfts downtown."
194519,25486771,284630547,2018-07-01,48154231,Chris,Eric’s place is a fantastic little pit stop for the night. It’s close to the best of Denver and the breakfast amenities are a nice touch.

At first I didn’t think it was going to be good but; turns out it was batter than what it looked in the pictures and reviews. Laura and Tony are awesome hosts, if you have questions they have answers. I really enjoyed staying here and not only was the room clean but the bed was top of its class lol if you are ever in town this place will be perfect for you!"
136590,19180922,492939615,2019-07-21,107377876,Travis,"This is a fantastic location, close to several great spots near downtown. We enjoyed being able to walk to breweries, coffee shops, and even ice cream during our stay. There were enough beds and space to accommodate our larger group (8 people total) and a really nice lawn area for relaxing in the cool summer breeze in the evenings. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay - beds were clean and comfortable, decor was tasteful, and there were plenty of provisions for the odds and ends that were forgotten at home. Overall we were very pleased with our stay. Thank you!"

Other than that, we LOVED the place. All of us was comfy and we had a small group too. So plenty of space to sleep and hang out."

7303,833937,6710304,2013-08-22,7343888,Lori,The house fit our needs perfectly. My teenage son loved the turntable and fabulous collection of albums from the 60s to 80s.  He was our disc jockey and we loved it. The kitchen was great and we were able to have breakfast every morning and then prepare a cooler full of goodies for the day.  The location was very central to many parks and we were able to walk to downtown.  We felt safe walking in the neighborhood at night.  We would stay there again.
69057,10747925,79428822,2016-06-12,1115339,Harrison,Overall perfect experience.  Check in/out was easy and upon arrival Billy provided us with free drink tickets.  The location was perfect spot to explore all that Denver has to offer.  Next time in Denver I know where I'll be staying.
104106,15330451,284597495,2018-07-01,137160753,Lisa,"This property is a beautiful little gem in the Barnum neighborhood!  It is quiet, comfortable, and clean.  There is a full working kitchen with access to whatever is in the cupboard and fridge.  Our host Tim was  so hospitable and gracious - even when we lost our key and were locked out!  He was very responsive to our needs/requests and recommended places nearby with delicious and authentic ethnic foods.  We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend it to others. Thanks for everything, Tim!"

244305,39003034,551755882,2019-10-20,94886106,Pamela,"My stay in this space was  amazing, the location worked out great for us it was close to a lot of restaurants and downtown. The view in the apartment is outstanding and the apartment itself is cozy and comfortable. Washer and drier are conveniently inside the space and the rest of the amenities are great as well! Parking was a bit confusing so I recommend arranging something to secure a parking space in the building through Karita. If you forget like us meter parking is $1 per hour max time is 3 hours and after 7 it’s free. This worked out for us since we were out during the day. I will definitely be coming back to Denver and booking again through Karita!"
90926,13789731,120927840,2016-12-12,102909790,Kevin,"The area of this listing is perfect. It's right next to one of the major streets: Colfax Avenue, which makes it easy to go around the area."
62096,9474354,114101508,2016-11-15,11582657,Tim,"This monastic set up is perfect for exploring a city independently.  The house is walking distance from one of the hippest neighborhoods in Denver.  The excellent public transportation is a block away.  The house is full of other short-term visitors and is a quiet, respectful place to rest after sightseeing.  "
198959,26281251,324692851,2018-09-17,201034733,Esmeralda,Conors home was really convenient and close to everything love that we had a place to sit out in the backyard.  Bathrooms are absolutely beautiful

It was super cute and clean, and Greg was the best host!! He was very quick to respond and offered suggestions of things to see and places to go!! Wow I did not want to leave!!"
135535,19102625,158869924,2017-06-08,626760,Daniel,"My friends and I went to Denver for a trip and fell in love with Charlie's home!  It's a really clean and comfy place with tons of natural light...we loved letting some fresh air in through the big windows and sliding-glass doors.  Two comfy beds (as well as a pull-out sofa bed), and two showers. There is also a half-bath on the living room/kitchen level.  The patio on the kitchen level was great for a relaxing breakfast and the rooftop patio was an awesome place to hang out and have drinks while taking in views of the Rocky Mountains (there's even a beverage fridge up there).  I wish we could have stayed longer, but next time we come to town I know where I will be staying! "
107315,15743145,243140029,2018-03-14,12450841,Bryan,Great space!! The beds were really comfy and the balcony was so handy.  Off street parking is a great bonus.  A highly recommended location for anyone wanting to enjoy all Denver has to offer!

51911,8352843,82179258,2016-06-26,64829214,Peter,"This is a terrific property! The hosts were friendly but not overbearing, and the unit was pristine. I really can't say too many good things about this property. We especially enjoyed the common grounds with firepit, grill and ping pong table. It is obvious that great care went in to developing this property."
219233,30012308,556481956,2019-10-29,23426947,Christina,"Highly recommend Carina's place for individuals, couples, or even small groups. My husband and I stayed for 5 days and it had everything we needed. Very clean, private, with good local tips and some toiletries. I forgot to bring my makeup remover wipes and I was so excited to see there were some in the bathroom! It is close to a bunch of shops, good coffee, and restaurants, but we even walked to the Nuggets game at the Pepsi center and parts of downtown on the nice days (just over a mile to get to the edge of downtown). The place itself is on a quiet street with plenty of street parking. We had a great stay here and would definitely come back next time we are in Denver!"

99526,14902544,108110172,2016-10-14,3570794,Giovanna,"The place was really beautiful and clean. The roof deck was pretty sweet. It's a very modern and comfortable place. Rachel and Fabian were really welcoming and responsive.

The main issue with the place was that it's a 2 bedroom, not a 3 bedroom as the listing claims. There are 2 queen beds, each in a bedroom, and 2 sofa beds in the main living space."
30678,4753876,91802303,2016-08-06,27446418,Dara,The RiNo Den was the perfect place for our weekend in Denver. Tina was a great host who was quick to answer any questions we had. The beautiful open rooftop was an added bonus to complete our night downtown. 
8194,861993,185812813,2017-08-22,133121529,Samantha,"John and Shann's place offers the perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of busy Denver. It's conveniently located about 10 minutes away from downtown and is situated in a quiet neighborhood. The space is well kept and comfortable. The instructions for parking and entrance were easy to follow. The kitchen had everything we needed to make simple meals. Complimentary laundry was a major plus after our two days of hiking. Overall, this is my first AirBnB experience and John and Shann's place made it very appealing. I hope to come back in the future!"

193632,25372201,275793314,2018-06-11,14019695,Steph,"The location was really handy- we were able to walk to some of the things we wanted to do though the traffic downtown did slow us down a few times. The apartment was well put together but the kitchen was missing a few key items. That’s why we went air B and B and not a hotel, but we improvised and made it work. Malissa gave us great tips and advice when I asked questions but didn’t explain the apartment/building very well. We never did figure out how to use the tv, had to figure out how to use the a/c by ourselves, and never did use the hot tub or pool because we weren’t sure if it was closed at certain times or if we could bring drinks etc... we just never bothered. Overall it was a great place and a good stay, but we weren’t impressed with the list of chores she expected of us upon leaving. I’ve never experienced that at an air B and B, and some of it was a little unreasonable."
8564,866145,294891435,2018-07-22,46118748,Katherine,Preston’s home was very clean and welcoming. The room was larger than expected. Preston and Jan were quick to respond with any questions. It was my first time staying in an Airbnb and it was a great first experience!
118426,16857174,235440108,2018-02-16,6728533,Kah,"Rodney's place was situated well to the airport line and the Greyhound bus station. It is also close to RiNo, an up and coming hip area. I only stayed a night which was good for acclimatising to the altitude on my way to the ski resorts. Rodney came to pick me up for a nominal fare from the train station which I appreciated for the time to do. The room was clean and bed was comfortable."

Noise was not an issue for us. Kinga is a fantastic host and extremely helpful. I can't wait to stay here the next time I'm in denver!"
165570,21975597,495183382,2019-07-25,55130133,Troy,"I had a very enjoyable stay at Doug's place. It is located in a fun Denver neighborhood with lots of great dining choices. A beautiful city park is nearby. The basement apartment is cute, clean and comfortable. It is a quick Uber or Lyft ride to downtown, or better yet, a relatively easy bike share ride. Doug provided great local tips before I arrived so I easily found some good restaurants. A great brewery, Cerebral, is nearby and worth a stop if you like that sort of thing. Recomended!"
91958,13845981,195284612,2017-09-18,133927762,Cassie,First time doing an airbnb and the reviews are all true! great comfortable place with a 5 min walk to the football stadium! Would definitely recommend.
179183,23596506,269064429,2018-05-26,184822999,Christopher,I totally recommended this place for anyone wanting to explore Colorado. It’s in a wonderful neighborhood and I can’t stress how comfortable the place is. It feels as comfy as home when you sleep due to the beds and sheets alone. The place is really clean and you have a ton of privacy despite his family being upstairs.
162526,21782254,338174912,2018-10-18,59802203,Kyle,Perfect little spot. Honestly no negatives. Loved the wine covers by the way.

The only downfalls were the couch was broken, so you can not sit back with out the back rest completely falling off. And parking for guest is confusing if you are not familiar with city parking and signs. but other wise I loved it."

We stayed here with 4 kids and everything was so kid friendly, including a tub with toys, a playroom, and a backyard for them to play. All the rooms are as described and everything was so well designed and comfortable. The home feels very well-loved and well- maintained. Pamela and Jim were very welcoming and helped us feel right at home. We parked in their driveway and their house is convenient to downtown (about 15 min drive) and near anything you might need. We plan to stay here the next time we come to visit family. Anyone who stays here is very lucky!"

I was able to walk downtown everyday, enjoy popular neighborhood restaurants and cafes... and walk to Trader Joe’s for groceries.

Keely went above and beyond in making sure I had what I needed, providing books, toys, a stroller and more for my daughter, and even Benadryl for me.

A big plus is that the downtown core of Denver is only 13 to 15 minutes from her house which is perfect if you are attending a conference there as I was.  Halley was an excellent host and I felt right at home from the minute I arrived.

Everything is clean and there is plenty of private and social space to relax. I stayed in the gold room and slept very well. I also used the ocean sound machine. My Uber took exactly 15 min from the airport and the house is in a safe area. I would recommend Peter’s place."
92101,13845981,434840387,2019-04-08,17864172,Hilary,It was a good location but a bit further away from downtown than I had anticipated. It was an affordable place to sleep and loved that the bathroom was in the bedroom too. I would recommend staying here if you are visiting for a short time.
12247,1733052,15230309,2014-07-05,16830897,Amelia,"Jason's downstairs private basement was great looking, comfortable and spacious; and Jason was very friendly and helpful.  The location was also great -- just a short 15-20 minute walk to the Capitol where you have access to a free bus that runs down 16th street and to the Lodo district.  I would highly recommend staying with Jason!"

69486,10928009,557240226,2019-10-31,138117437,Amanda,Great space! Very unique. The ONLY downside is you can’t have your own pillow or blanket at the establishment. I understand why these rules are in place but one pillow isn’t as comfortable for me

135818,19116550,188222226,2017-08-28,65975174,Cinthia,This place is awesome! We appreciated the mini fridge and microwave! Downtown Denver is only 15 min away and your near to many cool bars and restaurants. They have 2 dogs which you can hear in the morning but we left early everyday so they didn't bother us. Great place to stay I would recommend.

84786,13260989,420140548,2019-03-05,120811886,Rachel,Super cozy space stocked with coffee and goodies to eat. We booked super last minute heading out of a snowstorm and Beth was incredible for the accommodating and even more incredible for shoveling the stairs before we arrived! Thank you so much.
210184,28340299,563690749,2019-11-13,120076254,Chris,"Absolutely lovely place. Traveling for work I use a lot of airbnb's and this location has by far been one of my favorite stays. Beautiful townhouse with high ceilings, and lots of space! If your're not into stairs though, this is not your place! Host were very nice and reached out to me at around 11 AM to let me know I can check in early since it was already cleaned (a first for me) Will be staying here again!"
54955,8671797,94487884,2016-08-15,50148236,Kelli,"We had a wonderful stay in the Carriage House Rachel was a great host--she made sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. She was accommodating and accessible, It was obvious she wanted her guests to feel well taken care of.
We loved the location and were able to walk to almost anywhere we wanted to go in downtown Denver (usually no more than 1-1.5 miles).  We would definitely stay here next time we're in Denver. It was such a treat!"

72563,11338921,217977334,2017-12-10,56124602,Amy,"Easy access to everything. The people in the building were extremely polite and getting around was best for us using Uber. You can walk to so many shops and restaurants from here. 

The vagrants that were in abundance across the street was unnerving at first but I have to say, coming from Houston, they were the nicest people I have come across. Never asked for anything, just how our day was and to have a blessed one. 

Keep in mind this is near a restaurant where it does get loud at night. 

We had fun and would definitely recommend this place."
760,592,4692947,2013-05-20,686684,Tushar,I had a great stay at Jill's place. She has a lovely home and is very welcoming of her guests. Jill was very accommodating of my arrival and departure times and I enjoyed chatting with her. Highly recommended!

My room had an enormous, comfy bed, views of the pretty back and side yard. The bathroom was immaculate with a great shower and a big cushy towel.  They have a very sweet dog and a cat. Both were home while I was there and they did everything possible to make my stay comfortable. Doreen even loaned me her bike for the day so I could get to some appointments. They offered coffee and breakfast, fast wifi and as I mentioned, stimulating conversation. I highly recommend them as airbnb hosts. "

144909,20282352,190603414,2017-09-04,35057628,Meghann,"Alexandra's place was so cute and so awesome. I felt cozy and at home as soon as I walked through the door. It was the perfect place to stay for a long weekend. I was on the go the entire trip so the no internet or TV was not even a thought let alone issue. The location was perfect for not having a car the entire trip...close to bars, stores and all the other good stuff you would want and need on a trip to Denver. It was a pretty quick/inexpensive Uber ride to and from Dicks as well. Alexandra was an amazing host who was super accommodating, friendly and available if needed. I would definitely stay here again if I was heading back to Denver!"

Brent and Beth were great hosts. The area is fantastic.  There is so much available in close proximity.  Shopping, restaurants, movie theatre, and don't miss Stanley Market Place.  Very family friendly area.  I plan on going back.  "
243519,38365365,542748753,2019-10-06,78622605,Abbi,"Our stay here was wonderful! The place was super clean, there were many amenities that we weren’t counting on. (i.e. toiletries galore) It was very easy to access and we loved getting greeted by their dog, Capone! Four girls traveling jsut with backpacks had a lot of stuff to unload, but the place was clean enough to feel comfortable laying stuff out. We locked ourselves out one day and Brett was right there to let us in! Definitely would recommend this stay."
18634,2957097,16081398,2014-07-22,15153468,Casey,"Jeffrey's place is beautiful.  The house is charming and wonderfully decorated.  The kitchen is huge with an adorable dining room attached.  The outside has a nice seating area and hot tub.  There's also a great view of the city from the lawn.  The beds were comfortable and exactly as shown in the pictures.

Note that there's another renter that lives in the basement.  There is no separate entrance for the renter, so he enters through the home to go downstairs.  However, he was VERY nice.  He also respected our space.  We only saw him once during our 4 day stay."

66282,10061459,508984342,2019-08-13,181641140,Z,"They are nice people and the location is close enough that a Lyft ride isn't too expensive to get to downtown. If you plan to see other towns in colorado I highly recommend a rental car. The Check-in process is fairly smooth. The room feels a bit smaller than pictured due to the lowered ceilings, but overall the stay was good."
96426,14440882,146127061,2017-04-21,117189627,Mary,"We enjoyed our stay in your home and with your individualized hospitality. As a hobby-gardener, your remarkable gardens helped us relax after being at hospital visits all day at NJH! The April cool weather was TX tolerable with the fireplace and parlour.

175803,23215919,289579087,2018-07-12,12981200,Nikki,Great location near Denver International Airport.  Accommodation was clean and comfortable.  Extra beds allowed us sufficient space. Having the entire upstairs was great and allowed us to have privacy even though we were in the same house as the hosts. Mary and David was accommodating with our late arrival which was much appreciated and advised us of local eateries. We would definitely recommend this accommodation.

We had some problems with checking in, but Justin made himself available and came personally to resolve our problems. We had a great time and the roof deck has a spectacular view of Downtown Denver and the fireworks. The garage is a bit small for large SUVs, but there is plenty of street parking around. Overall, it is a great place to stay in and the upstairs shower is quite a simple pleasure.  I would totally recommend this space."

The space is perfect for four people - clean comfortable, and has everything you need from cookware to cleaning supplies and bathroom items.

132580,18754423,410760831,2019-02-10,94408515,Lysetta,"Whitney's  home is convenient to everything in Downtown Denver via Lyft if you happen not to  have a car during your stay.  Lyfts are very plentiful and arrive  within 2-5 minutes.We flew in to Denver Airport, took the train to Union station and from there  it was a cheap  quick 10 minute  ride to this beautiful, spacious modern  and elegant (but not stuffy) home. The home is very spacious and is equipped with everything one would have in their own home, excellent wi fi. several channels,  a firepalce , full size stove, refrigerator and  plenty of pots pans and utensils. The bedrooms and bath rooms are on the second floor  and there is an additional bath room on the first floor-no shower so be prepared for stairs. I did not mind as I appreciate the cardio opportunity!The home is located in an area with several newly developed row homes and the area is in transition with quite a bit of construction, but this was not bothersome in any way and did not affect the quality of our stay, it was surprisingly quiet and low key and we stayed for 9 days!.  The lake is  about 1/10th of a mile away and  gorgeous for walking around.Check in was beyond simple and convenient and  we were allowed to check in a bit earlier -We checked ahead of time and were graciously accommodated which was  most appreciated. You will be very happy if you select this location for your stay in Denver. Better than a 5 star hotel!"
21634,3487191,31331547,2015-05-04,30004653,Michele," I had a pleasant stay at the carriage house. It was just as advertised.  It was plenty of room for me to stretch out, and it was clean and comfortable. I didn't get a chance to meet Nathen, but he left helpful information and was reachable on his cell phone if necessary.

The area is a great location, with a few minutes walk to Broadway and its many restaurants and bars. Downtown is easily accessible by bus, Uber (usually less than $10), or a 20 minute walk.

This was my first experience with airbnb so I was a bit apprehensive, but it worked out very well. For the space, location, and price you can't beat this property."

I would definitely recommend anyone who is staying in Denver for a trip to definitely book with Dan and Tiela. Great communication before and during stay. Lovely home in a nice area, minutes from airport. I can't even wait till the next time I come to Denver. Believe it or not, it's even better than the pictures. "

The neighborhood is safe, and the home is in a great location.  Check out City Park! The room came with water, a small coffee pot, coffee and tea, guides about Denver, and a small book collection.  They also provided us a fan and fresh towels upon request.  On the morning we left, they left us a few leftover pancakes on the table!

We will definitely try to book again for our next trip to Denver!"

It was clean, decorated nicely, and had some amenities that made traveling for us so much easier! The house came equipped with a pack n play and high chair which was a big help for us as we have a small infant and were traveling across the Country. Another great thing is that Jason and Jordan are incredibly fast with responses which made all the difference for our family and vacation. We would absolutely stay here again!"

124405,17530389,344489778,2018-11-03,3138532,Mingah,"I picked this Airbnb because of location, pictures, and other guests' reviews that said ""very clean."" No doubt, the location is great. There is a great gym and coffee shop within two blocks walk.  However, the place could use a professional deep cleaning and some light maintenance. There were layers of visible grime over several surfaces and in many corners. There was dust over the blinds, on the window sills,  along the condo molding, and random splashes of stuff on the kitchen partition wall. This is easily curable. If the host fixed this and made sure everything was working prior to check-in, this place would be solid. There was an issue with the dishwasher that prevented me from using it. We did as much as we could to consolidate our used dishes. The nightly rate is very reasonable, just be prepared to do a once over wiping."
142364,19893591,198838325,2017-09-30,9681246,Kayla,"Wonderful place!  Literally everything you need down to a fan in the bedroom.  You're also within walking distance to some pretty cool restaurants and shops.  Check in was a breeze with the instructions provided, and the bed was super comfy.  I only wish I could have stayed longer."

152780,21024898,533517190,2019-09-21,39978686,Lela And Scott,"Fabulous location within walking distance of restaurants and beer pubs and things to do.  Super clean, quiet, comfy beds; easy check in and Zach responded quickly to anything you needed. Because there was only street parking, if you came home late, you sometimes had to park a block or two away but a safe area to walk in.  Totally enjoyed our stay."

126911,18018738,191010555,2017-09-05,28717915,Joe,"We booked this house to host a 10-person bachelor party over Labor Day weekend.  In all facets, the house and host met or exceeded our expectations.  Great location, awesome house, and the feedback and support from the host was second to none.

LOCATION:  Centrally located to reach multiple neighborhoods and downtown Denver either by a long walk or short car hire rides.  We had no issue quickly and cheaply getting to multiple restaurants, bars, Coors Field, and other locations from the house.  Multiple grocery and liquors stores in close vicinity to help stock the house during your stay.  No issues with neighbors or surrounding area.

CLEANLINESS/AMENITIES:  House was very clean and inviting upon arrival.  All rooms had made beds with associated linens and additional airbeds/sheets available for use as needed.  Plenty of towels and soaps/shampoos available for use within the bathrooms.  The host has a thorough check-in binder with information and available pamphlets/brochures for activities within the surrounding area.  The kitchen is stocked with all cooking utensils, dinnerware, etc. you could need to cook dinner and host a full dinner party if desired.  

HOUSE:  The house itself is updated and comfortably accommodated our group.  Three large rooms with king beds can accommodate multiple people.  One upstairs room with large bunk beds (full or queen size on the bottom bunk) comfortably accommodated four adults and were some of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept on.  The downstairs front room has a comfortable futon as well.  The upstairs deck was a great outdoor spot to hang out and the backyard comfortably hosts guests if worked out with the host beforehand.  A surprise upon check-in were three arcade game consoles that were free to play and were an added value to our stay.

HOST:  Will was always quick, responsive, and thorough in all communications.  He truly went above and beyond to provide recommendations and advice for activities that set us up well for a successful weekend.  Will lives on-site and can be a valuable asset during your stay.  The house itself is awesome but the host truly goes above and beyond to ensure your stay here is exceptional.  

Would highly recommend this location to any prospective guests and would stay here again if in the Denver area.  Wish all Airbnb experiences were this good!"

Walking distance from a bunch of good restaurants,  cute vintage shops, and easy access to the light rail/buses to go downtown. We even used the Bird and Lyft scooters to explore around this area and get to downtown, usually less expensive than an Uber and super fun. Also not a bad drive at all to Red Rocks, Boulder, and Golden."

6084,746298,157858774,2017-06-04,3246687,Lauren,"I had a delightful stay in the ""Dreamy Suite!""  Buffy is a consummate host, swiftly providing clear information about the space, neighborhood, and check in, and, as others have noted, intuiting the precise amount of interaction with guests called for in a given situation.  Coffee and her famous pumpkin bread in the morning, and even fetching me a replacement iPhone charger when mine quit, were extra-appreciated!  

The townhouse itself was very conveniently located for me, in the Lowry neighborhood and close to the Town Center with a Safeway, several restaurants, and other shopping.  It is also near the historic Eisenhower chapel and Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum.  I felt very safe walking around the neighborhood day and night.  A sweet pocket park and a larger park with a playground are nearby as well.

The suite was very clean and comfortable, with great sun exposure and blackout curtains - best of both!  The bathroom is just outside the bedroom door.  The home is filled with well-curated art, making the space cozy and welcoming.  Buffy's thoughtfulness to the needs of guests is apparent everywhere you look.

I will keep my fingers crossed that the Dreamy Suite is available for my next trip to Denver!"
97901,14728998,293143425,2018-07-19,100679380,Alison,"No worries.  I was a bit nervous about doing a private room Airbnb.  Here I had my own bathroom with shower and jet tub, my own mini fridge and coffee/tea bar, my own deck, my own fireplace.   So private that I never met my hosts!! Heard Steven’s voice once and the puppies as I came and went during the day.   Loved the cafe around the corner.  The ac made the room a dream even in full sun facing 100 degree heat and it acted as white noise lulling me to sleep.   Next time I’m going to schedule more time to just chill in the space.   Yoga sunbathing reading writing journaling computer work could have done it all.   Did some but next time more.   Book this place if you want local safe flair but also enjoy retreating to quiet calmness.  "

202628,26892290,489432351,2019-07-16,208557550,Jeff,"This unit is much too small for 4 people. The main bedroom has barely 2ft of space in front and on the side where the door to get out should be except there is NO door meaning no privacy. The second bedroom has no A/C, if you stay here in the summer that room is  a miserable hot box. Just how small is this unit you wonder? There is just barely 18 in. from the wall and edge of the sink in the bathroom. The kitchen is no better. It’s so small the fridge door hits the wall when you open it and blocks the A/C unit. If you are traveling with your children this is not the place for you"
4954,665622,12915493,2014-05-14,3789341,Pearl,"This condo in the Highland District is very nice and quiet.  It is a quick drive to downtown.  The condo was very clean and has a pair of LG front load washer/dryer, which was very convenient for us. I would have liked nicer cooking pans, but if you don't cook it's not a problem.  There's a Sprouts nearby!"

If you guys look at all the previous  reviews during the winter time and spring  time everybody would love it but this house was not good for the SUMMER.

It was a nice, cozy retreat for us and it felt like coming home after all the day's activities.

Very walkable - tons of shops, pubs, restaurants, and museums.

David's place is very comfortable, and he is very accommodating - gave us some great ideas for exploring Denver.

Would most certainly go back, and wouldn't hesitate recommending staying with David.

Bonus: David is also a talented photographer and artist - he had some great photos and artwork displayed."

The two full sized beds were very comfortable and be aware that the other bed is firmer. There was a lot of light in the bedrooms, the house warmed up well and the living room/kitchen was great for entertaining. Location was close to downtown and it was easy to get everywhere. Parking super easy right on the street. "

They also have dogs, which despite their best efforts, had left hair around the house.   Otherwise it was clean and well appointed."

We were in Denver for a weekend of wedding activities and Bill and Linda's place offered a lovely resting place between events. The guest house was clean, easy to access, wonderfully decorated, and provided plenty of space for the five of us. Bill and Linda greeted us upon arrival and had lots of great information about things to do and how to get around. We had an easy time figuring out transportation - there is a bus that we caught on 38th (three minute walk from the house) that got us downtown in about 30 minutes (depends where downtown you're going). We also enjoyed walking around the neighborhood. There were multiple grocery stores nearby, and Bill and Linda also provided us with some snacks when we arrived. Overall our stay was everything we could've hoped for, and we would definitely recommend to other guests traveling through Denver!"
32601,4978830,175805698,2017-07-29,42763680,Kelly,"Araceli's place was perfect for our family of 7; it's very spacious and had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. Our nephews really enjoyed the lower level and pool table while the adults enjoyed having a quite area upstairs where we could relax. The location is great; convenient to grocery stores, restaurants, etc. and was a perfect home base to day trip from.  Araceli met us at the house to show us around and was available via text if we needed anything; however, her home is set up so well that we had no need to call her after we checked in.  I would highly recommend Araceli's place for large groups and/or families. We hope to stay here again when we're in the Denver/Lakewood area. "

126826,18014902,165078357,2017-06-30,17290913,Julia,"Brian & Michele are gracious hosts. Their home is in a lovely setting, very comfortable, and conveniently located right near downtown Denver as well as various parks. The space itself is very unique and warm--hand-made wood furnishings with extremely thoughtful touches, including novels on the bookshelves and coffee/tea/biscotti in the kitchen. The beds rival any 5-star hotel in comfort, the fully-equipped kitchen is perfect for any cooking needs, and the bathroom has great water pressure and bluetooth speakers! The private entrance even has a blackberry bush that we snacked on! From the moment we arrived, our hosts were there to greet us, help us with our luggage, and show us around. They are so kind! Thank you, Brian & Michele-- we look forward to staying with you in the future!"
127507,18123887,166511022,2017-07-03,86558870,Stephen,"We had a great time staying at Scott's place! Listing as described, very clean, and in a great location. Communication was excellent, quick response time to any questions we had. He went out of his way to let us check in early and check out a little late so we were not having to carry our luggage around Denver while we waited. Would definitely stay here again and recommend you do the same!"

Host was easy to communicate with and place was clean prior to our arrival.

126321,17845387,156498630,2017-05-30,127063175,Nitchapatr,"My friend and I went to Denver for the first time on the Memorial Day weekend. We both really enjoy the stay with the Kenzies. 

The house was very nice, clean, and well-organized, I personally love the bedroom decoration since teal is my favorite color. It's really nice to have privacy even though we were renting a room in the big house, but a downside was we only ran into the hosts a few times throughout our visit. They're so kind and courteous, not to mention very informative and flexible with us coming and leaving at odd hours; we arrived around 2 AM and left for the airport at 4 AM . 

Karen and John provided very useful information on place to eat, shop and hangout in Denver even before we get there. In the guest room, there's a folder containing great information for the first-timers like us plus a cute note to introduce their 3 little kitties; one of them came down to greet us one day, I think it was the female who was really cute and so cuddly. My girl friend is a cat person so she was really happy to play with her. Their 2 tween were very nice, and had such great manner. Even though they practice music in the morning, that didn't interrupt our sleep at all. They sure will become good musicians like their parents. I cannot thank them enough for their wonderful hospitality.

For someone who likes to skip to the end of a book, this part is for you. In short, we had such an enjoyable visit and great memories from this first time being in Denver and Karen's place played such an important part of it. We're hoping to go back for our second very soon!

107908,15766497,299346161,2018-07-30,117553339,Terry,Jacobs place had a great location! It is a small spot so only good if you are a couple sharing a bed or a solo traveler. The space is a studio off the back of a house and although it is tight quarters it does feel like a nice pricey space. For the price it is great! 
52883,8410937,285750902,2018-07-04,60294135,Jessica,Great stay near everything that we wanted to see from downtown to red rocks amphitheater!

She was really good at responding and helping with any of our needs!! Her place is also 420 friendly which was a plus since my friends and I are heavy smoker so the back yard and front porch was perfect!!

I loved the neighborhood, just over the Platte River, a 10-minute walk from Union Station--where the light rail comes from the airport."

All necessities were provided & the place was decorated beautifully...not to mention the bed is super cozy. The weather was nice, so I was able to take full advantage of relaxing on the patio. I absolutely love the quiet & quaint neighborhood. A short stroll will bring you to a strip of fun, local, delicious places to eat/drink ... the biscuit place is da bomb & Chowder Room has a great happy hour.

Sammy and Ozone were a joy to play with and helped elevate some of our homesickness.  We really hated to leave.  We had so much in common and Nikki was full of great suggestions for places to see and go.  Sadly we were on business and just couldn't squeeze anything else into our schedule.

Things to know..  It is a basement apartment.  The neighborhood is quiet and easy access to main streets.  Read the guest book, it is full of good information and suggestions from former guests."

Most stuff we visited in Denver was no more than a 15 minute car drive away. Check-in was super easy and it was nice to have a private, no-fuss spot to come back to every night after exploring cool restaurants or beautiful mountain vistas. The space was clean, street parking was easy to find, and the bed was fairly comfortable. Though you can go the entire stay without interacting with your hosts, know that they are quick to respond if you need anything. Definitely recommended."

The place is extremely clean and has many unexpected touches- coffee, teas, very helpful house manual, interesting books about history of Denver and neighborhood. 
Grocery store within walking distance, so are different eating establishments. Public transportation- bus, tram ( light rail) just around the corner although it was enjoyable walk up to 16 th street mall or very inexpensive Lyft.
It was one of the most comfortable, thoughtful and clean place that we ever stayed."

Just a few minute cab ride to downtown, its incredibly convenient to anything you'd want to do in town. The apartment was very clean and comfortable, and I slept like a champ. They had really nice additional touches that you don't necessarily find in other places. Toothpaste, snacks, and drinks. Definitely get in this place if you're in town!"

The house was cozy and clean, the perfect size for my boyfriend and I. It was an hour and a half from our ski destination in Breckenridge and half an hour from hiking at the Red Rocks Amphitheater. The food he recommended in Denver was amazing and I would definitely stay at his place again."

Great space,  small,  comfortable. Love the Keurig In the kitchen,  it enables my wicked coffee habit.  Love the Baker Neighborhood,  before I moved away from Denver in 2003 u lived for about a year and half around the corner on 4th,  so I'm very familiar with the neighborhood,  and enjoy the easy walking access to restaurants and bars. 

Nathen is an amiable and easy going host,  leaving you plenty of privacy,  but easy to get a hold of,  and very responsive. 
Thanks Nathen,  next time I'm in Denver by myself,  ill be looking you up."

The bed was extremely comfortable, and the room great if your by yourself or traveling with a couple people. It's too bad we were both so tired from traveling because I don't think the stories would ever have ended. Thanks again Jill."

There are a couple of excellent cafes nearby for coffee and possibly tasty taco shops. The lower level is super private and quiet in a very modern town home.

The check-in was very easy and Derek is very kind and always willing to help. We had a car and we always found parking in front of the house. We really liked the garden.
The location is nice, nice neighborhood and very close to Washington Park.
I totally recommend Derek’s place!!!"

43795,7131495,83815570,2016-07-04,62690575,Laurel,"This is a gorgeous, historic neighborhood. I walked around for hours just photographing the amazing architecture.  I was in town for a conference at the Convention Center, which was a lovely 2 mile walk away through upscale, historic areas. Christiaan was a great host. He met me on arrival and provided me with everything I would need. The house is over 100 years old, so I would not recommend it for someone with mobility issues (lots of narrow stairs), but for someone on a business trip to Denver, it's a perfect, cozy place to stay."
130582,18473767,199987652,2017-10-03,5891444,Amber,"Well appointed, super clean and cozy. Close to downtown and conveniently located in a neighborhood spot surrounded by great  bar, restaurants and coffee shops. A+"
225114,31540416,487073119,2019-07-13,33792043,Christina,"Super cute hostel, officially the best I’ve visited. Very convenient location within easy walking distance to many locations. Lots of common areas. There is noise at night but this was expected due to the proximity of lots of fun nightlife."
137876,19404313,496445713,2019-07-27,253034919,Laz,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

197601,26130792,470054536,2019-06-15,27169157,Amanda,We loved our stay at Curtis Park Club! The room was nicely decorated and spacious for us. We especially loved the location. RiNo is such a fun neighborhood and we tried new spots in that area every day of our stay. This Airbnb is also walkable. We were able to walk to and from the Rockies game one afternoon and enjoy a walk to and from Confluence Park the next. We had no trouble finding street parking either. Communication was quick and easy. We'd recommend this space to our friends and family and we'd love to stay again one day.
25233,4051568,479344908,2019-06-30,48398494,John,Great place to stay. Plenty of room to relax.

205941,27554725,442935438,2019-04-24,245363272,Brenden,"Jeremiah’s place is a small house in Park Hill, which is about 20 minutes from downtown Denver. Close enough to get to where you need, and far enough away from the city to be nice and quiet. 
The room has a Queen sized bed, red curtains that block out most of the light in the morning, a good sized dresser and closet for your clothes, and enough pillows and blankets to keep two or warm and comfy. 
The bathroom is shared, but Jeremiah usually works at home and is good and patient for anyone who needs to use it. Jeremiah is thoughtful enough to have some toiletries that are for use by anyone who forgot shampoo or toothpaste. 
The kitchen is gas stove and a good size, Jeremiah let us use the bottom of the fridge for our own groceries and let us cook when we wanted. He even shared his coffee with us! 
Every 4th Wednesday there is street sweeping so you can’t park your car in front on those days. Otherwise parking is usually really easy to get in front of his place. 
There is a little high table and stools in the living room where two people can sit and eat a meal together. The living room also has a large smart tv that can connect to your laptop or smartphone and was cool with us watching it whenever we wanted. 
At the time of our visit we paid $30 a night, but I have to say that we would have happily paid more for the place and it’s excellent host."
53346,8427693,276386720,2018-06-13,79760758,Sarah,"I couldn’t imagine a better place to stay! Great location, super clean home, very private, and super friendly hosts! They have great tips on things to do and will make your stay very enjoyable!"
189918,24778264,456897527,2019-05-22,203833994,Carla,"The description is on point and the area is an upcoming area that is being revitalized in Denver.  The houses around have a lot of character and is close to the Art District which is fun and has a lot of things to do.  The hosts are on the premises, so their response it super quick!"
199707,26333386,527798829,2019-09-11,91403909,Josh,"This place has a ton of potential. We rented the whole place for 6 couples to the tune of $4500 for 2 nights. We added “breakfast” for $100 per day. 

The good is that it was a great location, comfortable, plenty of common area and privacy. Great location for a retreat in the city. 

The bad. When we arrived, the gate to the parking lot was locked shut. There was a code to the garage so we parked one car in there and called the host Damien. He told us that since we rented the whole place, we could park a car in there, but the other 2 cars would need to be on the street because the gate was broken to the parking area. No big deal, street parking is pretty easy. After we settled in, the host who lives on the property walked up to us and said “Hello, someone is parked in my garage. I’m about to leave and that car needs to be moved when I get back.” I told her that Damien had told me we could park there, and she said that he had done that before and she wasn’t sure why. The breakfast was complete with rock hard pastries and no kettle for hot water for the oatmeal. There was never enough cream for 11 people to have coffee. They did have some apples out, the rest of the fruit was peaches in light syrup in plastic sealed containers. 

On our checkout day (10am checkout) the gardeners arrived at 8:30am. Guess what, they opened the gate right up and parked in the driveway where we were told we couldn’t park (even for the $25 per day listed price). Then the cleaners arrived and started in on our rooms at 9am. 

My expectation when spending that kind of money is to have a little more hospitality and care. This would be 5 star without a doubt if they can get that figured out."
139354,19508251,241314107,2018-03-08,176085480,Joe,"Description of property was correct; the exterior was fairly simple yet the interior is what fascinated use. It was clean, cozy, and creative with all the amenities one could ask for."
94223,14055472,422185403,2019-03-10,2967977,Kellie,"Bev was a great host! She was very easy to communicate with and quick to respond. The house was filled with food, drinks, toiletries, everything you could need. This made our trip so much easier once we arrived to all of these amenities. The house is beautiful and very spacious. We had 10 girls staying for a bachelorette party and we had plenty of room to sleep and get ready with 3 full bathrooms. It is a quick and affordable uber ride into LoHi, LoDo, RiNo. The Uber usually was only 2-5 mins away when we ordered them. There’s isn’t too much to do within walking distance (we did walk to city park) but this wasn’t a big deal to us. Overall 5 star stay! Wouldn’t have changed a thing"
14496,1959918,295013037,2018-07-22,56451869,Wrudiger,"Quiet location a short walk to a large supermarket. Don't be put off by the slightly shabby exterior, interior is nicely remodeled with all the expected amenities. Mike was communitave and wanted to be sure we had a good experience. Recommend."

House is cute and antique! Bath robes, black out curtains and excessive pillows were a great touch! All very clean. Kitchen is well stocked with utensils and randomly stocked with some great tea and mediocre coffee (we opted for buying our own)."

My only suggestions are that there should be more than one roll of tissue left for guest who are staying several days and the couch needs to be replaced. It is dingy and the only eyesore in such a lovely place."

That being said, we could hear some traffic from the highway with the windows open. The house was super clean!! Very cute bathroom and kitchen. We slept like a baby on the bed after camping for a week prior to traveling to Denver. Mary Grace was very prompt with all our communication. The off street parking was a plus as well. If you're looking for a place central to downtown and don't need a large space, this is the perfect little spot!! Made going downtown to explore super easy. Awesome first trip to Denver. "

Her home is a beautiful arrangement of relaxation and the virtuous vibes of her seemingly perfect neighborhood. The location is within walking distance of downtown and at the center of blossoming social scene that Denver continues to add to its outskirts. It was absolutely two of the most enjoyable days I've had via and air bnb and will certainly look up Ellen again next time I'm in the fantastic city of Denver, CO. "

The living space was very roomy and comfortable.  Check in was perfect...Cassie just sent us a code for the back door.  The back yard was really neat too...firepit, comfy chairs to lounge out in... We really love this house.  Can't wait to go back!"
43240,7070662,171058257,2017-07-16,15572983,Karina,Cute and spacious home.  Home was as advertised.  Great place for a group guys to stay!  House was clean and owner was flexible to allow us to stay later which really helped with the guys who had later flights.  Close to Denver nightlife.  Definitely recommend this home.

67148,10248217,156676076,2017-05-31,26170059,Nicanor,Emily's house is AMAZING! I've lived in Denver for a couple of years and the location is perfect! It's walking distance to Tennyson Street which is becoming a hip street full of shops and restaurants. The area is quiet and has two beautiful parks that have lakes that are wonderful for an evening stroll. Emily was an excellent host and communicated with me quickly and clearly. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. 
35964,5746214,297884731,2018-07-28,204348784,McLaren,It was a very beautiful home in a beautiful part of Denver. We felt right at home!

232934,33587662,497771638,2019-07-28,35906691,Liesa,"The space is modern but has character. It felt welcoming and was stylish. The linen and towels felt brand new and squeaky clean. 
The rooms are large and open with plenty of room to move. The beds were ultra comfortable and the pillows were good quality and felt like home! 
I loved the smart home features and easy check in. 
I was worried that the parking was first come first served, but we found a free space each time we came back. 
Close to downtown but without the noise. Loved it!"

Kevin was very responsive and helpful and the location is just awesome. About an 8 minute walk to the botanical gardens that are fantastic! And such a great little block, there is a small market, a few great cafes, and a cute little coffee shop steps away from the front door. Wonderful place."
195283,25614605,513650449,2019-08-19,181531494,Kate,Zack’s house was super clean and conveniently located near the airport and shopping center and restaurants. It was nice having access to the kitchen and washer/dryer. Zack also came to the rescue with having a printer for me to use when I had to print something for work. Biscuit is also a super sweet cat who was so friendly to us :) highly recommend if you are traveling to Colorado!

111694,16087125,273920586,2018-06-07,193492424,Tessa,This was our first Airbnb experience... and it was beyond fantastic!  Julie’s place is in the middle of a great Denver neighborhood.  Felt safe the entire time and location was close to everything! We went with a toddler and newborn and we immediately felt at home.  Super clean. Super cute.  Great for the price! Julie was beyond accommodating and thought of everything when it came to providing a place to stay.  We will absolutely rebook with her when we visit again.

81255,12990793,111945881,2016-11-02,36704806,Gina,"Patricia was extremely helpful on arrival and departure days.  She made me feel right at home and even let me keep my things there until my flights were to leave.  I was near everything in downtown, but far enough removed where I felt more at home than I was just visiting.  This was an awesome location and a fantastic experience, I would stay here again in a heartbeat!."

1751,59631,70902194,2016-04-21,61582787,Joe,"Julie was very accommodating and easy to communicate with.  Her house was very comfortable and close to restaurants nearby.  Our group got caught in a snowstorm and her house proved to be a very warm shelter from the elements. We were forced to dine in due to the elements, and the ambience her home projected made our dinners amazing. This was our first time ever seeing snow.  We were able to build little snowmen in her back yard along with the requisite snowball fights :)  Truly an experience we will never forget.  Thank you Julie."

94693,14151673,324772809,2018-09-17,132110162,Robert,"I was in Denver for a flag football tournament. I shared the home with 9 of my teammates. The home accommodated the 10 of us perfectly. It is an amazing new home, with plenty of amenities. The washer and dryer definitely came in handy since our uniforms needed to be washed every day. The kitchen was stocked with a number of small appliances, such as a toaster, toaster oven and blender, which we used. We also made use of the ping pong table and basketball game that was in the basement. I can't say enough about the place. Jared was a great host. He always responded to my questions promptly. If I ever need to book an Airbnb in Denver again, this will definitely be the place that I will check for availability first."
20845,3425074,365813417,2019-01-01,128309545,Emelia,Kimberely is the sweetest host! Easy checkin and very accomodating to our needs. Replies promptly and great location. Definitely reccommend:)
193794,25422304,504386481,2019-08-07,5172544,Gabriela,"Kristin was welcoming, friendly and kind. The room is very spacious and my pup and I were very comfortable. Great location and very walkable neighborhood. The home does not have a/c and Denver is experiencing a heatwave so it was a little warmer than I anticipated but the 2 fans in the room helped. I would stay again and recommend!"
174809,23063850,414144580,2019-02-18,111599454,Mike,This is a basement apartment with two bedrooms and a small bed in a closet and no washer and dryer in the unit. Parking can be a challenge.

135678,19113386,505020444,2019-08-08,21384942,Michael,Great spot in a cool neighborhood. Just steps from some great bars and restaurants + really quick to get to other neighborhoods.  A great home base for exploring Denver!
107283,15743145,158179796,2017-06-05,115077849,Daniel,"We rented this unit for a group of 8 old friends enjoying a weekend in Denver as a ""family reunion"" of sorts.  It is not the most walkable neighborhood, but there were several good food/beer spots within walking distance.  Dan was a very responsive and gracious host.  It is very easy to get an Uber/Lyft from the location, and it has everything you could need for a fun weekend or a working retreat (the loft-style ceilings and desk upstairs felt like it would make a very cozy office-away-from-the-office if necessary)."
232549,33526716,559738691,2019-11-04,159797244,Jordan,"Great place! Perfectly located and very clean. Does share a wall with another family, but had no problems. Overall great value"

The host was accessible and checked in to be sure all was well.  We loved the neighborhood and ate at 2 local restaurants within walking distance and good coffee options in the morning. Two thumbs way up! "
40193,6471872,99692950,2016-09-05,3902495,Allie,"Megan's home was clean, comfortable, and spacious. The checkin/checkout process was easy.

Kimberly is very easy going and kind, and very accommodating. The apt is located close to great things and a short walk to many busses."

This was my first Airbnb experience and it set a really great impression about what future Airbnbs should be. James and his family are very friendly and happy to chat in my experience as well look after any needs you have. Could happily recommend James's place to anyone."

55727,8718728,426033641,2019-03-19,172934395,Oscar,Really cozy place with great location. This should be your go to if you want to save some money and still be able to get the most out of your trip to Denver.
92901,13901522,431379521,2019-03-31,128303221,Elizabeth,"It was great for what we were using it for - a place to sleep for the weekend. However the room was really small and it was tough to have a whole suitcase in there and not much space for our belongings. As well as essentially nowhere to set anything in the bathroom, except on top of the toilet. Not necessarily a bad thing - just something to keep in mind! Since there were photos of the kitchen and living space on the ad, we assumed we could hang out in those areas instead of being confined in the small room, but the host was present in the areas most of the time we were at the house and we were not under the impression that we were allowed to use them. The host was kind when we saw her and she seemed chill, we would have appreciated if the use of the common areas were more clear because we would have liked to hang out outside of the room. But the place was in a good location, close to bus stops and easy to find for Uber/Lyft."
123315,17386946,295991897,2018-07-24,62895989,Matt,"This is a neat place. The cat is pretty cool, but he may have been overwhelmed a little by the energy of our 10 and 12 year old boys."
148736,20722746,252908983,2018-04-12,87594869,Shawn,This was my 3rd stay at one of Jack's homes.  It was awesome just like the first 2 . If you are looking for all Denver has to offer look no further.  Close to everything you need.  Check out starfs for great sandwiches .
67361,10266757,256469648,2018-04-22,141530527,Justin,"The place was nicely upgraded, clean, and in a decent location. We could walk (1 mile or so) to a few different neighborhoods that had bars/restaurants (including the area around Coors Field). It was a short Uber ride downtown (2-3 miles). Overall it was a good stay with plenty of privacy."
164931,21896498,287957002,2018-07-08,49662521,Caison,Very clean and quiet private room. We grabbed cheap Uber’s all over downtown. Uber to Red Rocks was roughly $20. We enjoyed our stay.

154963,21125445,296002056,2018-07-24,48763432,John,"David's place met our expectations. It was clean, spacious, and great for our short business trip. He was very accommodating and responsive, and provided thorough instructions for our stay. The location was ideal for us, as it was a close walk to our client's office in the heart of downtown, and also close to great bars and restaurants. I would highly recommend David's place for anyone looking to stay in the heart of Denver. Unfortunately, the Rockies weren't in town during our stay, but I would take advantage of a game if you're in town as you can see Coors Field from the window!"

27559,4263661,423299156,2019-03-13,245023125,Jordan,Melissa and John’s home was beautifully decorated and perfectly located near downtown. We stayed in the basement bedroom and the only complaint we had was that you could hear all the noise from upstairs. However it never caused too big of a problem. We would stay here again :)

We loved the quirky details, and the location was central to everything. Nicole and Kate communicated with ease and were very kind. We are really grateful to have used this place as a home base to explore the beauty and grandeur of Colorado and the surrounding area! "

She owns the lounge downstairs and the whole staff was great (Especially Jared the bartender who made us feel right at home the moment we walked into the bar). The apartment is beautiful and comfortable. Lots of natural light. I'm sure we'll be back, thank you Kinga! "
165980,22032668,436264694,2019-04-12,37673062,Melissa,"This apartment has a fun layout and is in a great location - we walked to a ton of places in Rino and downtown! 

Chad & Susan's team were very responsive and communicative. We have no complaints about their customer service, but some things about the physical space could have been better. 

Temps reached 80 during our stay, and there's no AC and no fans. The sleeping loft got VERY warm. There was no cold water in the bathroom sink, which I noticed was mentioned in a previous review and hasn't been fixed. It also snowed (crazy weather!) which caused a leak in the roof that last night of our stay. The property management company assured us that maintenance would be out in the morning, but we left before they arrived."
186549,24344869,523035561,2019-09-02,176242293,Nathaniel,Pete was friendly and available even for a very short stay. He’s very organized and detail oriented. Great place to visit.

He met us at the condo which was exactly as described. Lots of art pieces on the walls which we enjoyed a lot. The building was very modern and well kept and the ""neighbors"" seemed to be a young professional crowd and quite dog friendly! The location was very central and perfect for a stay in the Denver area. We could walk to everything we visited but there were also enough public transportation options available. We felt very comfortable at Mason's!"

244521,39181811,557258631,2019-10-31,154996175,Robert,"THE BED IS SO COMFORTABLE. The sheets are so soft and the bed is just the perfect blend of soft/hard so it didn't hurt my back. Check in is very easy and hosts are responsive & help out in whatever way they can to make it a nice stay. The only criticism I have is that all the times I've tried to take a bath, there isn't enough hot water to fill it up entirely. The shower gets very hot though. I appreciated the electric fireplace, it made it easy to stay warm and adjust the warmth in the room."

Tons of coffee shops, restaurants and bars to choose from and there's a grocery store a half mile away. His place is quiet and Blake is a super gracious host - he offered me the beer in his fridge, encouraged me to reach out with any questions and I felt well taken care of during my visit. I would definitely stay here again."

121775,17240564,219126662,2017-12-16,72580796,Les,Can’t beat the value and location. 5-8 min Uber ride anywhere downtown. Will definitely stay here again if available for our next trip back to Denver.
46212,7557038,498986486,2019-07-30,54651777,Ashantee,"We LOVED the Carriage House. It is a small space that is perfect for 2 to 3 people; and is private and quiet. Everything was super clean and exceeded our expectations. Stan provides all the basic amenities and a few snacks, we didn't even have to make a trip to the grocery store. The stairs are bit on the smaller side, and could be tricky to maneuver if you have mobility issues. The location is perfect, right in the heart of downtown; we walked to dinner almost every night. We will definitely be looking to stay here again when we return to Denver."
211275,28556261,448909559,2019-05-05,189297,Nick,"Really enjoyed this place. Great location near a ton a good restaurants and more. It was clean, had all the needed supplies, outdoor space was cute, and loved having in-unit laundry during my long time. Having a parking garage space was also really convenient for us as we did a lot of day tripping around the area.

Also, the host was super communicative and helpful during our stay, even late at night.

I'd definitely stay there again!"

42371,6891514,160576199,2017-06-14,17612684,Jessica,"I needed a last minute place to stay, and Elizabeth's place was the most affordable and close to downtown for commuting to work. I liked that the room had its own private entrance, mini fridge, and coffee maker. Elizabeth had water, coffee, juices, fresh milk, and snacks available when I checked in.

Elizabeth's place isn't the fanciest so if you're looking for amenities, you may want to keep looking. This was just right for what I needed, and Elizabeth was respectful of the fact that I wanted/needed to be mostly left alone. Plus, I loved getting to pet her sweet pup, Shiloh, when I needed to use the bathroom."

224814,31509096,493521655,2019-07-22,124307460,James,"Thank you for an amazing stay in our first time in Colorado. We were very late to check in due to car troubles, but Tami made sure we were comfortable and settled in when we got there 10 hours after our scheduled check in time. Our room and shared rooms were very clean, organized, and smelled really nice. The bed and bedding were comfortable to the point that it felt like sleeping on a small cloud, and the patio/balcony was filled with plants, a nice view of the thunderstorms, and comfy pillows to rest on. We also arrived in the middle of a heat wave, and there was a fan in our room to help us stay cool. Tami as a host was very sweet, and gave us privacy, conversation, and recommendations as we needed it - our only complaint is that we couldn't book a longer stay with her because of our spontaneous planning!"
184352,24083668,541117925,2019-10-04,216097575,Maggie,This was a very convenient location with a lot of restaurants and shops within walking distance on Tennyson.

216818,29489384,359929703,2018-12-18,31260736,Yuxuan,"Good, clean place near downtown Denver. Comes with all the basic amenities, as well as a nice shared kitchen that you could use if you should so like. Your experience may differ based on the other guests, though, since you'll be sharing a small space, so it's best to keep that in mind."

136731,19207597,211301653,2017-11-12,153435448,Crystal,"Ben’s place was charming, clean and the perfect place for my friend and I during our stay.  It had all the essential amenities and we were lucky enough to even enjoy the outdoor patio!Checking in/out was a breeze and Ben allowing us to leave our luggage in the garage after check out was a huge help to us.  The location is quiet and residential but I wouldn’t recommend walking around at night.  There is a grocery store a short drive away where you can stock up on food to save money on meals as well as a liquor store right around the corner.  We didn’t mind the 10-15 minute Uber drive everywhere but if you want to be closer to the action then this may not be the place for you.  Overall we loved it and would definitely stay here again!"

Only a couple blocks away from the downtown core, a very short Uber drive or a 10min easy and safe walk will take you there.  The roof top patio is a great place to relax.

The room was on the back side of the upstairs so it was nice and dark and quiet overnight for a good night's rest. Even though it wasn't a completely private place, we felt alone and comfortable. I would recommend it. "

There is only one bathroom and the kitchenette is limited to a hot plate and no sink, but there's a Keurig for coffee and the host takes care of dishes. The location is wonderful, we were a group of 6 so we took ride shares around and it was reliable and fast! Absolutely loved our time here. The decor of maps and local nature was the perfect touch to make it feel like home away from home. Matt was super responsive and helpful whenever we had a question (which wasn't often, because the guides and check in procedures were very well written). If I'm ever in a Denver again with a group of people, I'd absolutely stay here again!"

Eliza is a remarkable hostess and is incredibly prompt in response if needed. It is very family friendly (my kids loved the piano). It is across the street from a school that has a playground you can use after school hours and on weekends.  The neighborhood is very quiet and very close to any and all activities in Denver. This place feels like home. Definitely recommend.

233206,33664011,519960072,2019-08-29,119714095,Justin,"Rick was an absolutely FANTASTIC HOST!  Met us for check in, and was very hospitable from the moment we booked our reservation. We traded some stories about Denver and Rick was one of the most genuine hosts I've ever stayed with. 
The home itself was GREAT! Great location near the zoo and just outside the chaos of downtown Denver. The game room was legit and provided some entertainment during our evenings. The bedrooms were super comfortable, beds were great, showers were hot and everything was spotless. Would definitely recommend  and will stay again the next time I'm in Denver. Thank you, Rick!"
7650,833937,348110930,2018-11-12,38114974,Ryan,Eliza's place was perfect for our trip! I will absolutely stay there again if it's available.
104516,15378908,566491773,2019-11-19,75218243,Marino,"A lovely home, unique find. The location was perfect for getting around town . A short walk to downtown or a quick drive to the mountains. Very clean and comfortable, hard to leave sometimes. Thank you."
82570,13059132,280647301,2018-06-23,20226878,Laura,This place is perfect. Great location and everything you need. Cute little outdoor sitting area to enjoy our morning coffee. Mary was so helpful and quick to respond. One of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve had. Thank you

172670,22825320,231333514,2018-01-31,18293445,Allison,Susan's cozy cottage is just the cutest! The space is full of character and charm. It's extremely clean and modern. The skylights and vaulted ceilings make the space feel big and bright. The apartment is equipped with everything you need and it's conveniently located close to restaurants and bars. Susan is an awesome communicator and extremely helpful in recommending places to eat and local places to go. It was perfect for my stay in Denver. Susan truly thought of everything! Highly recommend!
193786,25422304,445571490,2019-04-29,125099956,Madeline,Kristin’s place is perfectly as described. The space is clean and has a keypad lock to the room to allow for privacy. We were able to get around town with no problem at all from her place. Kristin is an excellent host and is very friendly but also does not encroach on your space. Definitely a great place for the value!
78036,12649682,99179699,2016-09-03,75496165,Alyce,I had a wonderful time! Beautiful home I felt so welcome! Had everything I needed in my room! Will be staying again!
171785,22657843,471979946,2019-06-18,76853275,Malissa,Jens guest house was super cute and stylish- very West Elm! The neighborhood was amazing and super close to the botanic gardens- and it was so thoughtful that they let us use their guest pass. We loved having a beer in their backyard patio with the beautiful string lights. Thanks for the amazing stay!
167066,22150777,249111082,2018-04-01,80838188,Ted,"The West Family was very responsive and courteous via Airbnb message before, during, and after our stay.  They even went out of their way to provide us with an iron and board upon last minute request, being that we were in town for a wedding!  Flexible lockbox check-in was just what we needed, and their standalone home was very clean, well furnished, and comfortable fitted with a working refrigerator, heater, all the basic amenities, and plenty of free onsite parking.  Centrally located, just 10-15 minutes drive east to downtown, less than an hour's drive west to the mountains for hiking, snowsports, etc.  We accidentally chipped some wall paint and a floor board, and they were very gracious in how they handled our accident.  Would definitely stay here again!"
239434,36037780,560396963,2019-11-06,70385497,Elliott,"Couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay during our trip.  Communication was fast prior to arrival and the check in process was easy.  Even got in a Little early so our toddler could get down for his nap.  

Lots of added touches like a pack and play already being in the condo to make traveling easier.  He also loved looking at the trains and the Ferris wheel out of the floor to ceiling windows. Parking spot indoors and  easy to get to from the elevator.  Just note it is a smaller spot for a “compact car”.  We had a Yukon XL which made it a bit tricky but it still worked well.  

Easy access to everything as the train is steps away and the freeway a few blocks from the place.  

Overall a great experience.  Would definitely stay here again."
112292,16115411,542738534,2019-10-06,4837935,Sean,Awesome place! Funky style we loved it!

Kate was very helpful and quick to answer questions. Selma is a sweet cat. "
66159,10061459,103291413,2016-09-21,94132275,Melanie,"The listing description was very accurate, the accommodation very nice, and we were well taken care of. Emily was sure to let us know the true details about the steps involved prior to coming, as I had told her that my traveling companion was mobility challenged. And despite the few steps up to the property, and the staircase down to the room, we were very happy. Parking was right outside the walkway to our room. I think the best thing about this property was the fact that we had our own entrance, and could come and go anytime with complete privacy and no worry of disturbing anyone. The bathroom was clean, with plenty of shelves and places for your own toiletries. The walk-in shower was big enough for two, had a large shower head, heavy stream of unlimited hot water, a window, and large shelf for toiletries. Emily had provided large bottles of scented shampoo, conditioner and soap, as well as toothbrushes, toothpaste, and mouthwash, and there was plenty of t.p. for our entire, 8-day stay. There was even a laundry hamper in the bathroom! The bed was large and extremely comfortable with six pillows, and a trunk full of extra blankets had we needed them. The room very quiet, and we had plenty of privacy. Three windows provided adequate light, and the blinds plenty of darkness. There was a trunk on which to put our suitcases. Emily provided lots of hangers for the closet, and there were numerous drawers in which to stash small things. The fridge and microwave were new and functioning, and Emily gave us plates, bowls, coffee mugs, wine glasses, a corkscrew, silverware, napkins and paper towels. She even had multiple large bottles of water in the fridge for us. When she learned that we were not coffee drinkers, she brought us a box of assorted teas. Emily and Steve were very accommodating. Emily checked in with us numerous times to be sure we had everything we needed. When we asked Steve for a couple of ziplock bags to pack our sandwiches for a day trip, he let us use his own insulated lunch bag complete with chilled ice pack, and Emily even offered me a ride to the rental car agency! We also received great suggestions anytime we had a question about the area. The location was very central to all we needed, access to the mountains, downtown, and local shops and venues.  I had no qualms at all about the safety of the neighborhood. It was our comfy home away from home and we'd definitely stay there again! "
39466,6357426,50096489,2015-10-09,17106,Jackie,"It was my first time visiting Denver for a convention and the proximity to the convention center was very convenient.  It is indeed a walk to everything:  restaurants, transit, hotels, drugstore and even TJMaxx - I needed to get last minute items I have forgotten to pack.
The place was well appointed and WIFI really good.
I will certainly come back!"
115706,16516286,562364766,2019-11-10,259672596,Chelsea,Close to downtown! Clean! Friendly Host!

Rita was generous with her time helping me think through the details of my relocation to Denver. Thank you Rita! I could not have asked for a more warm, positive experience."
16815,2267500,469005968,2019-06-13,74916108,Shannon,Cute place with a lot of charm and character.
90596,13752452,355779733,2018-12-05,24079981,Carson,You know that saying a house is not a home - this is a true home. Very warm feelings and very cozy vibes. I would recommend to anyone who wants to feel at home.

58027,8965601,204115857,2017-10-16,86786066,Deryck,"Tom was a great host. House was very clean, and in a great location. Tom made our stay very comfortable and easy by giving some advice and even checking in during our stay. If your going to a Broncos game it's the perfect place to stay as it is walking distance to the stadium. I recommend staying here to everyone who is visiting the Denver area."
158157,21355645,526967969,2019-09-09,53109633,Allison,Hanging out at Hugh's place is like visiting a brother. He's relaxed and laid back. You're part of the family including the pup!
215010,29283226,407630321,2019-02-02,234556838,Theodore,Tonya was an excellent host and provided very good communications. The home is very clean and comfortable. It made our visit to Denver much more enjoyable. We would stay here again and can recommend it to others.
16541,2257217,438462504,2019-04-16,66265153,Paige,"It was a great location! Easy to walk to many different places. The room was great just for somewhere to sleep. It’s a little tight for two people and to use the bathroom you go out your door onto the deck and it’s right as you walk into the house, and shower is upstairs in the house. Beth was an amazing host. So kind and thoughtful."
193164,25327520,291872090,2018-07-16,36036913,Eric,"Tomiko's place was wonderfully located and exactly as advertised. She is a great hostess who responds quickly with everything you need to know. Her place is fun and eclectic and I very much enjoyed the little notes with tips she left scattered throughout.

Would definitely stay again!"
160019,21580126,283789017,2018-06-30,174616065,Chris,"This was our first experience with Air BnB and everything went great!  We were close to the train station, which made coming from the airport convenient.  The house was very nice and updated on the inside.  Zach was very responsive to our questions, and accommodating as well.  Thanks Zach!"

161720,21712656,508348729,2019-08-12,260686540,Robert,"Chris is an awesome host!  He responds quickly to questions,  is flexible with timing, and offers great suggestions for things in the neighborhood. His condo is homey, clean, and in a great location. I really enjoyed the balcony in the evening and in the early morning with a cup of coffee. His building is secure, well maintained and quiet aka no loud parties!  Chris offers friendly hospitality at a great value! I will not hesitate to recommend his place to family, friends, and colleagues traveling to Denver. Great Host! Great Value."
122450,17316601,426990669,2019-03-22,155930495,Renee,"Ruby and Dorothy have a beautiful home and made me feel like family. If you’re looking for a centrally located place to stay near downtown Denver, I encourage you to give their place a go. The area is quiet, the room is spacious, clean, and has a private bath which is so hard to find. Everything was wonderful. Parking was never a problem. It is 2.6 miles to Denver city center. There are local eateries and pubs all along Broadway and within walking distance.  

Truly a great experience."
69205,10927209,442021052,2019-04-22,27826088,Hazel,"Overall, the location is great! Right in the middle of downtown denver. However, at nights it does get noisy with the bar downstairs and the restaurant next door. I recommend to Uber everywhere as parking is very limited."
16209,2257217,78376935,2016-06-06,10089203,Eric,"Beth and Jim were great. The house is very nice, and we were able to use whatever we needed. The room was off the back of the house which gave some privacy. It was great getting to know Beth and Jim, and their recommendations of what to see in Denver were spot on! Really enjoyed our stay!"

221140,30563692,400620206,2019-01-12,59825,Karen,"This lovely apartment is in a great location. A quiet friendly residential area. Every amenity has been laid on, there is no kitchen as such but enough provided to make a light meal, breakfast etc. Spacious bathroom and very comfortable bed. Relaxing space."
108321,15800346,223680737,2018-01-01,37829829,Piper,"The location is convenient to local hot spots and is great for hoping on the highway to get to boulder or the hills. Bring your own ice since there is no ice machine. Don’t expect a 5 Star room for a 2 Star price. It’s a great little spot, you get what you pay for. It was comfortable for us 2 as a couple, more would have been crowded. There is a dish washer that made doing the dishes a breeze. There is no coffee table at the love seat sofa. There is a Keurig but not a normal coffee pot. All in all, for the price, we are on the fence of whether we would stay again or not, but we are picky. It’s in a prime location, and appreciated the parking ease and private enterance."

The room, the house, the  neighborhood — it was all even better than I expected. 

I couldn’t imagine a better experience with my first use of AirBnB and I would highly recommend Peggy and Todd!"
237754,35288308,472911046,2019-06-20,248448554,Nels,Great location for downtown and a trendy quiet building with a fantastic swimming pool area and fitness room. Stephan was great to deal with and I’ll definitely be staying here again.

It has everything we needed for a group of four.  Larry`s daughter met us and showed us the condo.  She was very helpful and even had a bottle of wine for us."
51154,8117043,94709861,2016-08-16,11395004,Bethany,We had a great time at Mckenzie's apartment! My two friends and I were here for a week on a girls trip. This unit was exactly as described and perfectly comfortable for the three of us. Mckenzie was always quick to respond and super helpful with suggestions for things to do in the area. This was definitely one of my favorite AirBnb experiences! The welcome basket and chocolates on the pillows were the perfect touch. And having Netflix and Hulu was the perfect perk for our lazy mornings!  I would definitely recommend staying here.
5493,665622,278720155,2018-06-18,55941948,Mary Kaye,"Becky’s place was clean, spacious, and totally worth every penny. We loved walking around LoHi for great eateries and local shops. We felt safe in this quiet neighborhood but not separated from the city. Check-in was super easy. 
We would definitely stay here again."
17505,2467260,192933001,2017-09-11,54154760,Claire,"Ryan was a great host! Everything was as advertised here. Very clean, comfortable beds, kitchen utensils and bath linens provided as well as a hairdryer and shampoo and soap in case you forgot your own! Ryan also checked in on us via messanger to make sure we were comfortable and happy. There were several great recommendations for things to do once we arrived. Ryan's place is in a great location, we walked to several places and took the Denver B Cycle (only a block away) or took a short Uber ride anywhere we needed. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Would definitely stay here again! Thanks again Ryan!"
122291,17270985,448990801,2019-05-05,165459498,Suzy,"Casey’s place is really interesting - we enjoyed the eclectic decorations and the front porch. The main floor didn’t have a bathroom which was a little odd. Floors were creaky, so our light sleepers took the upstairs bedroom. Casey was willing to give us a tour (although we didn’t have time) and help with any local tips. Overall, cool place in a great neighborhood!"
90233,13751968,133972047,2017-02-25,13480017,Leigh,"Brooke's place is charming and beautifully decorated. I would recommend this location to short term travelers and sound sleepers. The kitchen is adorable but not ideal for cooking although there are lots of great restaurants near by for someone who prefers to eat out. This is a charming old building but for those familiar with old buildings you know walls can be thin. This might be problematic for most light sleepers. That said, if you plan on being out on the town most days/nights you will love this location. The apartment is very walkable to just about anything fun to do in Denver."
7395,833937,28253056,2015-03-21,1453527,Katie,Eliza's home was extremely charming and cozy -- I loved the artwork and the record player especially. I felt very safe in the neighborhood and was within walking distance to many bars and restaurants. I highly recommend staying there if you find yourself in Denver!

148694,20715678,246115922,2018-03-24,176169239,Linda,"It was centrally located.  Clean.  However, if you are comfortable sleeping in a place that is someone’s prime residence, with all his personal belongings around, including food in the fridge, then you’ll do fine.  I personally felt awkward and uncomfortable.  I assumed I was renting a vacant unit."
209450,28131765,457683969,2019-05-24,38376488,Sam,"Brooke was super easy to communicate with, provided many recommendations for places to eat (Noshery burrito was so good), home was super clean, and great location. Would definitely stay there again!"

The place was clean, cozy and comfortable! Very stylish and family-friendly. The neighborhood is quiet and hip. The Starbucks down the road was extra nice.

We specifically enjoyed the deck of cards at the house, as well as the super comfy beds, the coffee/cream, and the very bright living area full of Denver sun!! Highly recommend this sweet place! Would definitely stay again."
66126,10040421,158787620,2017-06-08,102884297,Jerry,"Stay away.  Filthy, old abandoned food in refrigerator. Moldy coffee grounds in coffee maker that did not work after cleaning.  AirBnB should revoke this host's account"

Free street parking in front is a major plus!  Check in process was easy, and Glen and Camille were detailed with their communication."

52539,8390543,93130528,2016-08-11,19423275,Lisbeth,"Logan's house was nice! Good location, small, but nice space in the basement level apartment. The backyard was completely demolished when we arrived and so it was a little off putting trying to drag our bags through the construction to get to the side door. I'm sure it will be great when finished it just looked rough when bringing my in-laws in ☺️ the apartment was nice but the beds felt a little small. We aren't huge people and it was snug. Otherwise communication was easy with Logan and the location is great. "

Although it's beautiful, cozy, and McKenna ensures thoughtful touches and open communication, the space's age may be what made it problematic. 

A lot of bugs from outside were constantly in our room (we killed about a dozen in three days). They weren't roaches, but I couldn't identify what they were. I'm not a fan of them either way. We also couldn't keep the lights on while using the microwave or the power would surge and we would have to reset the breaker (which happened twice). While packing to leave, I also found a woman's blouse beside the bed from a previous guest. 

Overall, our stay was good -- McKenna was available when we had questions, respected our space, and provided our room with bedside Ferrero Rocher chocolates, a supply of coffee, and other homey amenities. The location was wonderful -- close to Colfax and other must-sees, but I think the room needs a little revamp on the maintenance end."

They made this experience so easy, comfortable, and fun for us and we can’t thank them enough for all their hospitality. The 3 animal friends Miko, Tobey, and Zeke will warm up to you quickly. We absolutely loved being greeted by them and hanging out with them on the porch. The apartment is a perfect fit for anyone staying a weekend or an extended amount of time in Denver. The location is excellent and close to many bars, restaurants, yoga studios, boutique shops, pizza take out, and wine bars. Uber is common in this area and we never had to wait more then 3 minutes to be picked up. Craig and Ricky and two of the most accommodating, kind, fun, and thoughtful humans we have ever met and we can’t say thank you enough!!! Looking forward to returning to Denver soon, we will definitely stay with Craig and Ricky again. Thank you guys!!! Much love, Jackie and Amy."

She is so close to downtown, restaurants, and parks! Ruby park is down the road(literally) and has some really awesome views for a nice morning. 
Her home was so CUTE! You have your own little upstairs pad with a comfy living room space you can relax and watch some movies after a long day in the mountains! (Mnt Evans is a beautiful 1.5 hour drive, worth it!). 
Her front porch is a little oasis of cute lights and comfy sitting. Loved sitting out in the morning drinking coffee that is provided in your room( great creamers I would add!) and enjoying that Colorado weather! 
I highly recommend this home for your visiting!"

Very clean with all updated amenities. kevin and Megan, although I never met them were very attentive and made sure I had everything I needed. they even ordered a fan from Amazon when one in the home was not working properly. No AC, but the fans and the fact that it is a basement level apartment kept the place pretty cool even in the 95-degree heat of Denver in July. thanks again!"

She also accommodated us with a late check out when I asked if there was a place to keep our bags for a few hours on our last day. The location was perfect. A quick walk, or an even quicker scooter or Uber ride to LoDo and RiNo and being in LoHi was great. The location was also convenient to many other places in Denver. Highly recommend her place for the location, space, and hospitality. Thanks so much again Lisa!"

58826,9080518,506470590,2019-08-10,82869296,Lauren,"The location is pretty great if you’re looking for a cheap spot to stay near Denver. It’s about a 30-40 minute walk to downtown, a 10 minute Lyft/Uber, or a 15-20 minute scoot! There are scooters all over Denver, and they’re very fun! :)

You’ll have an entry room with washer and dryer (both work great!), a bathroom with all the main amenities, a sitting room with desk, table, chairs, coffee maker, mini fridge, and microwave, and a bedroom with a flat-screen TV and several DVDs.

Be warned, there is no a/c, so it can get pretty hot in the summer. The place has a box fan and a couple of small fans to use, so it’s not too bad. I just wish I would’ve read closer, so I want to share this information with others! 

The shower is small and the curtain wraps all the way around. I’m not a super broad person, but the curtain touched me on both sides no matter how I moved. Not great, but it is what it is.

If you’re light-sensitive when sleeping, you should bring a sleep mask, because the shades aren’t blackout and the street lights are bright. The king-sized bed is a little slouchy... not the most uncomfortable bed I’ve slept on, but it was nice after a long day walking around the city.

Monica is very receptive to messages and quick to remedy any issues! She is a first-class host. You’ll be in great hands with her."

However, as it is the basement of the house there is not a lot of privacy, a kitchenette, or much cell service. It would be best if you just need the place to rest for the night."

His home is also clean and modern, as well as situated in a quiet neighborhood. It was great to have a private bedroom with the additional lounging space of the 1st floor. A friend and I stayed at his place for a few days and really felt a sense of hospitality: Gerry would check in with us from time to time to see how we were doing, but always in a very caring way.

Highly recommended - don't hesitate to stay here on your next trip to Denver!"

I would come back at her place for sure if I will be again in Denver. "

The place is very clean and has a modern look to it, the bathroom and kitchen are well designed. The apartment is a close drive to downtown Denver and also close to restaurants and bars. The 2 rooms are small but enough space for you to hang up your clothes. The only disappointment was the couch pictured. The couch pictured look very comfortable and was the reason on why I choose this place for the third person however the actual couch in the apartment is a very hard, short leather white couch. Luckily our friends in Denver had a blow up mattress we had to use. Overall the stay was pleasant. I recommend this place to any traveling couples or friends who don't mind sharing a bed."

I was grateful to spend a few days here and felt like I had so much room to relax and enjoy this space.  Very clean and quiet.  I thought I saw a hammock in the pictures, but didn’t see it when I arrived (maybe I missed it).  Also the cold water knob for the spa tub didn’t seem to work so I ended up not using the spa.  However, everything else was truly wonderful.  Beautiful clean bathroom with an awesome shower.  The bed was very comfortable.  I appreciated the water and coffee.  This is a basement unit so I expected to hear a little noise from above in the morning as well as when Molly let her dog out to the yard, otherwise it was pretty quiet.  Molly kept in communication with me and I appreciated that she reminded me about street parking.  Thank you Molly!"

We had a bit of n issue with the lock on the front door but it was resolved easily. I would definitely recommend this property to others while in Denver. As a first time visitor, it was great!!"
240862,36851163,502614030,2019-08-04,119001105,Drew,"We really enjoyed our stay at Sonia’s place. The hospitality was excellent during our stay, and her unit was clean and spacious and in an awesome location. We especially enjoyed the rooftop patio and quiet neighborhood. Sonia was very helpful and friendly as well. Give her place a look if you’re in town and looking for an affordable but comfortable place to stay!"

119976,17044680,168963504,2017-07-10,121069911,Kassandra,Great location for exploring Denver. It's the perfect distance away from downtown and in such a beautiful area. The room is stunning and very comfortable for two. Annabelle & Christian are great communicators and were extremely flexible with our crazy check in and check out times. We briefly met two of their housemates who were also extremely friendly. We would definitely recommend. 
90177,13751109,514206249,2019-08-20,267450454,Tisha,"Location, decor, and personal touches were wonderful. It truly felt like home away from home. House had small personal touches (my personal favorites were fresh flowers, couch blankets, and toiletries). Location was amazing, you would walk to many restaurants within 2-5 min or take the pedestrian bridge to downtown quickly. We loved our stay and will be coming back soon!"
171943,22727793,314492479,2018-08-26,109696763,Jess,"This place was way better than I expected. It's the perfect hangout. Unfortunately I wasn't feeling well and slept most of the time I was there, but the bunk was private with dark out curtains and the AC was on. Add a pair of ear plugs and combined with the heavenly mattress and pillow and I slept like a baby. "

53855,8474753,512679329,2019-08-18,182555414,Melinda,This place is such a cute and cozy studio space with a great location. It was one block away from the main st which was full of great places to eat. It was about an hour 1/2 away from bierstadt trail which I highly recommend going to. I really enjoyed my stay.

24963,3992779,291426934,2018-07-15,30502275,Deepa,"Elizabeth was accommodating, responsive, and allowed for a late check out. The house is in a nice area and close to all the fun stuff downtown. The one drawback is that it’s a basement unit with no AC so it was hot and musty without great air circulation. The bathroom was also pretty small with a small shower so it was hard to move around. But it was a cute spot and easy to get around.  Thanks, Elizabeth!"

115953,16548314,331108041,2018-10-01,31737365,Bonnie,"- definitely cottage-style; kind of fun
- appears to have a bug issue, but was taking proactive measures (fly swatters and tape)
- ac is only in main living area, so night in the bedroom got quite hot
- check-in and out was easy
- parking was simple (win!)
- toiletries supplied (nice!)

While it was not a bad experience, I likely would not choose to stay here again."
123066,17341684,195527438,2017-09-19,57831080,Sathya,Comfortable place and Alex made sure that we had access to the house and can come and go at weird hours due to our plans.

32852,5070640,50842356,2015-10-15,37845668,Ed,"The carriage house was a great place to get away for a few days. The place was immaculate, renovations appear to be recent, and the unit is well maintained. Perfect for a single or a couple. The location was very convenient, with plenty of restaurant choices in the Highlands Square area. "
85549,13447168,122920705,2016-12-26,102736538,Anna,"We had a wonderful stay here! The space is so warm, inviting, and comfortable. Everything was clean and well-organized. Judy and Marty were so thoughtful and made sure we had everything we needed. It was also a huge bonus that it was so child friendly and really helpful that we could use the Pack n Play there. Highly recommended!"
130559,18449124,555353034,2019-10-27,12155431,Maggie,"Great place to stay with nice little touches to make you feel like home (coffee, kleenex, lotion). Very cozy and perfect for me and my two girlfriends.  The house isn't very big, so I wouldn't recommend staying here if you want some privacy from your fellow house guests.  Would stay here again, Kristin is a great host and very responsive."
224984,31520049,469499489,2019-06-14,179213781,Angie,Lovely stay! We enjoyed staying in their adorable guesthouse. It’s a beautiful and private little space and I’d definitely recommend. They were also very accommodating. A great couple nights!

16360,2257217,201700541,2017-10-08,10936206,Maria,"Beth is a great host. Her place is very conveniently located, and the room itself is clean, comfortable and easily accessible to the rest of the home. She also helpfully included guides to her home and to Denver. I appreciated that she was willing to get the room ready for me a couple hours earlier the day I checked in so that I could make it to my conference on time. I didn't have much time at the home due to my conference hours, but the morning I saw her she was lovely to talk to. Overall would definitely recommend her place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Denver."
26788,4227772,323461867,2018-09-15,72327678,Eden,"Lynne's place is amazing. The host is incredibly sweet herself (and her dog is adorable). She has the most thoughtful amenities. The place itself is also great- suuuuuper cute, has wifi, air conditioner and fans for the summer, and easy/secure/private access to get in and out. It is also in an awesome location- close walk/bike to great coffee, beer, and food: example- 12 minute walk to Epic Brewery. Couldn't recommend it enough!"

Bed was great! it's a memoryfoam mattress, so it is firm, but forming. We slept great! Nice, quite back patio. We took our lab and although small for her, she played a lot back there. We entertained a business colleague while visiting and it was a great, cozy evening. The location was fantastic! Close to everything, easy access to the highway. Allison responded to email instantly. Very gracious. We will definitely stay here again!"

One thing everyone in my group noticed was the quality of the bed sheets! They were super comfortable and soft to sleep on. I would stay here again and recommend the place."

Located at the heart of Cherry Creek, one the nicest areas in Denver, this property is a full basement apartment; it was very clean, comfortable and convenient to get to from anywhere in town. It is a perfect place if you’re looking for a restful stay – it’s amazing how quiet it was, despite being in such a central spot. Highly recommended if you’re staying in the beautiful city of Denver – I’ll be back, thank you!"

152464,21013413,318816326,2018-09-04,16859841,Kirsten,"Jourdan's place is perfect as far as location goes - about a 15 minute walk to downtown Denver and just a couple minutes by car. There is no dedicated parking that we found, so be prepared to park on the street. The house is located in back of an auto store and we saw multiple vagrants sleeping and hanging out on the auto property directly adjacent to the house. They didn't bother us, but the area seems like it may be a bit seedy. The unit is secure, with a coded entry to the common area and stairway and the unit itself had a coded lock as well, though both codes were on an outdated booklet, so not sure how many people have the codes as it seems they may not be changed often. The unit itself is small, but functional and showing it's age. The bathroom had some mildew on the shower walls and hair from a previous occupant on the baseboards. The kitchen had a small amount of counter space, so it was tough to cook anything but basic meals. The kitchen fan and ceiling were caked with dust and in need of cleaning. The bedroom was very small with the bed taking up a majority of the room, so much so that you had to turn sideways to get on either side of the bed. On one side of the bed a lamp was plugged in and the cord was hanging halfway down the wall so you have to dodge that and the end of the bed frame is super sharp and cut me multiple times while I was ducking the cord. The TV hangs off the wall by a couple inches, so you have to duck that when getting into the other side of the bed. The bed itself was not uncomfortable, but sagged in the middle and the egg crate made sleeping quite hot. There is a window unit in the bedroom which worked great during our stay. I was disappointed by Jourdan's lack of response and help. The listing says to ""consider us your personal concierge"", yet when I reached out for recommendations, he told me they were in a book in the unit. No help at all. I tried to add an additional day to our stay and Jourdan did not return my messages for over a week, close to 2 weeks."
129661,18331882,441131381,2019-04-21,191090102,Alexander,"Perfect location, stylish, sparkling clean apartment. David was very easy to communicate with about checking in. Highly recommend, especially if it is your first time visiting Denver!"
69275,10927816,557238652,2019-10-31,132057850,Qylie,Everyone was extremely helpful here! I arrived later around 7/8 pm and the employee working was very helpful. There is a gorgeous bar/restaurant (Ophelia’s) that was below the hostel that hosts a very fun drag show on the last Wednesday of every month. I would recommended anyone to stay here!
94738,14170039,97694025,2016-08-28,59648489,Azabe,"Stephanie was a more than a generous host, making me feel welcome into her home and offering to help me on my search to find a new home in Denver. Her place is very spacious for one person and also cozy. The neighborhood is quiet, yet is only two blocks from South Broadway, which has plenty of restaurants and a fun bar scene if that peaks your interest!  I wish I could have stayed longer, highly recommended!"
88165,13560410,120756264,2016-12-11,9544687,Tasha,The host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Our two dogs settled quickly into the place, Darja was in contact as to when we could get there and how to access the rooms. The rooms were clean, and inviting. 

The neighborhood is in a great location.  We love the older neighborhoods, with the smaller brick houses in Denver, and this neighborhood is definately one of those. It is a walkable neihgborhood with easy driving access to everywhere we wanted to visit in Denver. When we come back, we will try to stay here again. "
133137,18805144,439760201,2019-04-19,211870778,Abbie,"We LOVED our experience at the Baker Farmhouse. It was such a cute space and allowed us to come back at the end of the day and just relax like it was our own space. It was super convenient to walk over to Broadway for dinner or to check out the shops, and there was a  Safeway just a few blocks away when we realized we needed to pick something up. Free street parking was always available in front of their place and it was just a short drive to just about anywhere we wanted to go. Would absolutely stay again!"

Tami accommodated our late arrival and was understanding that we wanted to go out for dinner and come back - and had no problem letting us back in. We were provided with snacks, towels, and refreshments as soon as we walked in the door and had a wonderful time sitting on the porch and experiencing downtown Denver!"

We had an extended stay and Casi made sure we had everything we needed. She was quick to respond. Her neighbor/the other half of the duplex was friendly as well. The area was quiet and we had no problems. The house was stocked with everything from toilet paper to laundry detergent. The space was clean and quite spacious. The beds  and couch are comfortable. This was one of my favorite Airbnb’s. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb and stay again.

27110,4236002,328244690,2018-09-25,12083208,Champe,"Great little cottage. Decent location. But the details were absent. No tissues, paper towels, soap, dishwasher ( I'm sure it said no dshwsh and I missed it). Shower is very difficult to navigate.  Someones left over shampoo and cream rinse were in there. My pillow case was put on inside out. Some stains on sheets. Only 3 towels n 1 wash cloth. 
A bit hodge podge property. No wine glasses. Very few coffee mugs.  No hair dryer. Some plumbing problems....
Could be great but they really need to work on the details."

His place has everything you will need for your home away from home. It’s so comfortable and cozy, and the added amenities are such a wonderful touch. I am so glad I decided to stay at Randall’s home for my short getaway in Denver, he went above and beyond what I expected, everything was absolutely perfect. Thanks again Randall!"
214454,29212648,423319895,2019-03-13,234634772,Jennifer,This was my first Airbnb and will definitely use David’s place again!  The house is super cute and we felt like we were right at home. He is super fast with responses and gave some great recommendations. I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a cute 2 bedroom!
242325,37652355,537489025,2019-09-28,44101586,Regina,Daniel was a very responsive host! He has a sweet space and offered meaningful amenities for a coffee drinker and bike rider. He has to balance housemate and guest needs which hopefully can come into balance favoring Airbnb guests down the road and if he can get them on board to keep shared spaces clean and tobacco free as well as air flow/sound at night he will be a super super host!

7561,833937,185516285,2017-08-21,16854715,Lisa,"Eliza Jane's home was the perfect place to stay for our weekend in Denver. The house is spacious (perfect for 4 adults), cute, well-equipped and clean. The backyard garden provides a great place to enjoy morning coffee and an evening glass of wine. Check-in and check-out were a breeze and parking is not an issue. Location is great, in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to downtown (metro station nearby too), stores, and other attractions."

37767,6017776,355323502,2018-12-03,32008368,Karla,This was such a cute and cozy spot. Not far from downtown. The Christmas lights were a nice touch. Super clean and just perfect for our weekend getaway. Loved the board games and tv/DVD player for movies. Eclectic and unique stay.

104868,15436226,129249941,2017-01-29,15271423,Eliot,"Adam's place was great and his whole team running the show there was extremely helpful and efficient. We were able to check in a bit early because no one was there the night before, which was super helpful. Sasha was our experience coordinator and she was available to answer any questions we had during our stay, which was great.

The location was super convenient to lots of nightlife and restaurants. Bar Red next door has a great happy hour, by the way. The only slight knock on the location is that it's not too close to light rail so you either have to walk a mile or bus if you're coming in from the airport using the train.

Overall this place is extremely luxurious and a perfect place for a weekend in Denver with friends. The kitchen/dining area is amazing for cooking large meals and entertaining a big group. It's a bummer (but also understandable) that the rooftop deck costs extra, but we would love to get access to that if we come back again and the renovations/upgrades are completed. 

I would definitely stay here again!"

Do not hesitate to rent this beautiful, charming, loved loft.  I did not want to leave. The beds are fabulous.  It is quiet and clean and warm. A Faribault wool blanket was in the LR closet as a special treat for a cozy night. The neighborhood is so charming!  I especially enjoyed the bone china in gold and white in the cupboard and the books that tell you all about Curtis Street and the deep history of the area.  Great TV if you want to relax for the evening - or walk with ease down to the Denver Central Market and get the veggie (Website hidden by Airbnb) die for.  Julie is an excellent host! Great tips are in her welcome booklet on where to eat and what to do.  When I come back to Denver - I hope this place is open (Website hidden by Airbnb) is the only place I would want to be!"

We had the entire basement to ourselves, which was recently remodeled and beautiful.  The space included a spacious bedroom with a huge closet, TV and on-suite bathroom.  Off the bedroom is small kitchenette with sink, fridge, and coffee maker with cups and utensils.  There was also a huge living area that made for a great office space for me during our stay.  The location of the unit is perfect – easy access to restaurants, I-25 and just about anything you need.  Our hosts were above and beyond welcoming and accommodating.  This was our first experience with AirB&B, and will definitely do it again!  "

Quiet night's sleep - so refreshing.  Comfortable bed, pleasant room with high ceiling, great towels.  Lots of thoughtful touches that show Stephanie has her guests' comfort and convenience in mind.  Excellent list of local attractions, restaurants, getting-around-the-city tips.  Host communication was SUPERB.  I will stay here again on my next visit.  Thank you, Stephanie."

We loved the neighborhood and could get to all different parts of the city without trouble.  Also, so helpful to have access to a garage and a locking door which doesn't require a key.  This airbnb is definitely worth it!"

Michael was kind and opened his home for me while I spent the weekend in Denver. For some $30 a night, I had a place to stay, was 10 minutes from downtown Denver, and right off of I25. Couldn’t have asked for a better host. I felt safe and had my privacy, which I really appreciate. 10/10 would recommend!"

I wish we were allowed to check more than one thing we 'loved most' because the aesthetic touches, the amenities, the local tips, the cookies and breakfast AND Tonya's rapid response to all our texts were ALL greatly appreciated. 

The neighborhood is quiet, and very attrative, with a lovely park only a few blocks away. A great location outside downtown. We look forward to another 'excuse' to visit Denver and the Retro Pad!"

The location is fantastic. A neighborhood of craftsman style houses that are close to freeways and downtown. 
Dawnelle made sure the house was comfortable and private. I was a little concerned about having people downstairs (Dawnelle and her son), but it was no distraction at all. We were able to work, sleep late, lounge on the front porch, all without distraction."

We needed to check in earlier than was available and they worked out a way for us to get the keys early. Which was very helpful. Nice part of town. Plenty of dives and a grocery store close for post-city exploring. The cats were fun too!

And when all of the hotels were booked up, this was a good option for a place to lie your head. It’s in a bit of a random area and a bit away from the main hub of Denver. But like I said, it’s what you see on the listing and I think it’s what I expected. So that’s good."

The decor in the house was stunning making for a relaxing luxurious stay. 

The home is in a PRIME location, we were able to walk all over wash park and even to cherry creek. 

The host is incredibly thoughtful and responsive. There were snacks and drinks in the fridge for us along with plenty of towels, trash bags, anything else you could think you need! Absolutely everything was taken care of and thought of. The host also supplied a binder with any possible instructions for things, important contact info, and loads of suggestions for food, activities, etc. 

Thanks so much for an amazing weekend ! "

The mall ride is just over the bridge outside of the building so all of 16th Street is within easy access.  The train is right outside the window and while the light rail doesn't make much noise at all, the heavy rail that goes by can be noticeable.  There are a couple of while noise machines that sound like fans that help a bit.  The place was fully stocked with toiletries but there is a Whole Foods right around the corner from the mall ride pick up if there's anything particular you need.  There is a B-Cycle stall at the park outside of the building which can also be used to get around if you have a B-Cycle pass or daypass."
60179,9173434,523051863,2019-09-02,45006885,Heath,"Preston's place has enough space to accomodate a fairly large group. We enjoyed playing cornhole, ping pong, and pool. There were also a couple large TVs which were great for watching football. The yard is immaculately manicured, has to be some of the greenest grass I've ever seen."

Mark was a great host. The back yard was very nice and peaceful. Also to repeat what everyone else has said, the shower/tub was amazing. Will be back to Denver soon and will stay here again. "

67079,10244515,59335944,2016-01-09,16154935,Charles,"What a fantastic place to stay! This is a gem of a house in a fantastic neighborhood. The owner is a designer and it's evident throughout the house. The finishes are perfect (Wolf, Sub-zero, Sonos throughout the house, standup shower and a claw foot tub...). Great alternative to a suite at Denver's best hotels--and this place comes with a beautiful backyard/outdoor space. My wife, baby, dog and I spent a wonderful week here. Very high-end while being super comfortable at the same time. Great host, great neighborhood, great house and great value. "
18839,2978155,17547997,2014-08-13,19440208,Ryan,"My friend and I stayed in John's apartment for one night as we passed through Denver on a cross country road trip.  John was an excellent host.  He met us promptly upon our arrival and was very friendly, even taking the time to point us in the right direction for food and entertainment.  His apartment was spacious, clean, and very comfortable.  The area itself was hip and safe, as well as only a short walk to downtown.  I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Denver! Thanks John."

107174,15674568,192933441,2017-09-11,72300925,Alex,So we flew to Denver from Florida last minute to evacuate from hurricane Irma. Travis was awesome at communicating right off the bat. When we got to the house we were pleasantly surprised at how nice it was and what a great neighborhood we were staying in. Felt right at home and totally safe. Not to mention Travis is the coolest host I've had so far on air bnb. He was super welcoming and made us feel very comfortable while we were there. Genuinely good dude. Definitely stay here when you're in Denver.

63114,9596444,317127857,2018-09-01,128544972,Ariel,"Bella is absolutely incredible. She’s very bubbly, easy going and nice. Made me feel welcome the second I walked through the door until the minute I left. The room was clean, cozy, and had everything I needed and more. For all the 420 friendly guests she even leaves you a piece to use while you’re in town. Recommended great places to eat and dispensaries too! Even with the bathroom being shared she keeps it really clean. Also you get the key to your room so you can lock your door while you’re away. This was my first Air Bnb experience and I was so nervous but Bella’s hospitality and the awesome location my trip even more incredible. So many things within walking distance too and you can walk to the train to take you all over downtown. The walk from the train that goes to the airport is a little over a mile and easily walkable. I would highly recommend staying here!!! I’ll always stay here anytime I’m in Denver"

She asked me what I and my family would need before arrival and checked in to make our stay comfortable. We felt we were very welcome and enjoyed our stay. Everything (bed bathroom) was clean and kitchen was well equipped. We found everything we needed. We also liked location. It is located in the very quiet and safe neighborhoods. It is also good for access to top places(museums, parks, downtown, shopping, restaurants) in Denver.  "

Although we were under the impression that we would have a whole house to ourselves, but learned upon arrival that the host lives downstairs and the guests get the upstairs to the house, we still really enjoyed our stay. Super clean house and within walking distance to downtown. Good choice if you want to be close to downtown! Julie is also very quick to respond to messages."

144897,20279733,503303340,2019-08-05,246586358,Nick,We recently stayed here for 4-5 days and found it to be a great spot for a couple (2 of us).  The hosts had provided a list of their favorite local hotpots and were very responsive when we contacted them with any questions. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good value and nice cozy stay with plenty of space to relax!
38492,6300806,287139578,2018-07-07,173341806,Rachel,John was very nice and welcoming. My room was spacious and there is a great set up in the backyard that’s perfect for relaxing. I wold absolutely stay here again!
174004,23005566,304503840,2018-08-09,28019401,Ashlee,"We absolutely loved our stay at John’s place. While we didn’t have a chance to meet John in person, he was extremely responsive/informative ahead of our trip and was quick to answer the questions we had upon arrival/during our stay. 

The place was SUPER cute. The backyard garden and patio were a lovely touch — we would have spent more time out there had we stayed longer than a night. The only bit of feedback I shared with John was to fix a flickering bulb on a really cool looking lamp in the kitchen (mainly just wanted to see how it looked lit up!). Also suggested that he get a portable tower fan for the space. The cool summer breeze from the basement’s little window couldn’t quite reach the bedroom, though we still had a great night sleep!

The location is amazing — we walked everywhere with our puppy. We hit up pubs and breweries like Racines, Denver Beer Co, and Prost — all of them were dog friendly and had great patio space. John left us coupons for a local bar but we were too pooped by the end of the day to cash them in. Next time! 

Also, if you’re down for adventure, we highly recommend downloading the “Bird” electric scooter app because those things are SO much fun to ride around, and you can just leave them wherever. *Tip* they have free first time rides — a quick (Hidden by Airbnb) search will pull up a promo code!"
211193,28545121,406186626,2019-01-28,68752051,Nick,I am going to stay here every time I come to Denver. Location and price can not be beat!

243660,38461764,550949212,2019-10-19,34852617,Sherrelle,"Cute place in a good location near a coffee shop and a couple eating places - like Birdcall that was literally at the end of the street (was very good). Street parking is very crowded and busy, but we found the parking space in the back. Cute house and good place to stay with family. About 1 mile from 16th Street Mall. We really enjoyed our stay here."

150723,20917414,214368560,2017-11-25,37074376,Terri,"The rental was a cheaply appointed DIY flip. Poorly executed. Poorly managed. There was very little thought to the needs of a short term renter. For example, there were no paper towels, no cutting boards, no clean sponges (there was one used sponge) and no tea kettle. The wifi was spotty at best. When we asked about kitchen supplies we were provided with a 1/2 used roll of paper towel left on the front porch. I will say there were plenty of bath towels which was nice. The bath tub was unusable, wasn't clean, did not drain well and did not hold water. The faucet handles were not securely fastened and one of the 2 towel hooks was broken off. The bedroom lamp that was placed on the one nightstand was not plugged in because there is no outlet near it. 
On the bright side, the location was great, very central and within walking distance to two of Denver's great parks as well as restaurants and coffee shops. Unfortunately, there was garbage overflowing from the trash cans out front and strewn about the walkway. Finding parking nearby was challenging after 5pm. 
We would not recommend this house at the price we paid."

201754,26688184,331797604,2018-10-03,118398636,Seth,Absolutely phenomenal location. Responsible host. Good dining options within a short walk. Great space. Comfortable beds. The patio and garage allow plenty of space to hang and chill.
72101,11295273,223777794,2018-01-01,33112545,Raquel,"Robin’s place was great! It was perfect for me since I was traveling alone & traveling to Denver for the first time. The place is exactly as described. Robin also has cute notes in reference to the place & surrounding areas which really stuck out in a positive way! Pretty much central location. Walking distance to a lot of neat shops & food spots. I’m pretty sure the most expensive Lyft ride was maybe $8, which was great to be able to get to the heart of downtown for cheap. The one & only thing to keep in mind is that the room is below the main house (basement) so if you’re not one for hearing footsteps above you, look elsewhere. However, it did not bother me at all because Robin & her husband/family were cognizant of that type of stuff at night."
110657,16025874,231141159,2018-01-30,17428206,Evelyn,Great place to stay if you're in Denver. The space is awesome and everyone in our party had their own room. David was super helpful when I couldn't find a hair dryer in the house and he had one delivered the next day! Definitely went above and beyond. I would stay here again!
67208,10250349,237909312,2018-02-24,5321140,Samantha,A great spot and comfortable stay for a group of folks! Benjamin and Kim’s communication and responses were great. They even went the extra mile on a specific request my group had!
202415,26849559,442096635,2019-04-22,74491259,Efrain,Sarah was a great host and super responsive with anything we needed. We only had one issue the whole trip which was the upstairs neighbor. We let Sarah know about the issue and she resolved it soon after. We didn’t have anymore issues the rest of the trip. I would recommend if you’re going to smoke to smoke in the driveway versus on the stairs of the back of house. That way you avoid any conflict with the upstairs neighbor.
208566,28004534,362997549,2018-12-27,35064625,Lonny And Deb,"Our family of four and three dogs had a great Christmas vacation at Brennan's home.  The home was just as the pictures and description indicated and had everything we needed for our extended stay.  Having a fenced yard for the pups was fabulous.  The location was awesome, neighborhood was very quiet, and we enjoyed several of the local pubs/restaurants just a few blocks away.  Also downtown Denver was just a short 10 minute drive (or Uber ride).  Couldn't have been more satisfied with our stay and would recommend it to anyone."
136560,19180922,434403140,2019-04-07,63596528,Ella,We loved staying at this house! In a great location and perfect for what we needed as a big group!

166350,22067634,346765215,2018-11-09,21183389,Robert,"Great location, communicative host. Good for a single night, as we stayed. Wouldn't stay for extended periods of time. Street noise existed but understandable for location and building. Noise in the apartment itself was just too loud. The older heaters and pipes were ringing and made sleep not the most comfortable. Beds were comfortable. Heating had no regulation. Kitchen could use some proper glassware, etc. Convenient location for a quick jaunt."
57833,8954951,167741956,2017-07-07,75578764,Brent,"Great place, very easy to find, and close to some great bars and restaurants. "

4119,575758,18699032,2014-08-30,2177586,J.D.,"The place was great! Kerry was really helpful. I was a last minute booking without a lot of reviews, but he took a chance and let me stay. We didn't spend a huge amount of time in the loft, but the time we spent was great. Cool place, cool neighborhood, great shower. All was wonderful. I'll be staying here again on my next trip to Denver. "

195292,25633164,292271813,2018-07-17,15231091,Terron,"This was by far one of the best AirBNB experiences I've had! The listing is accurate, the place is super stylish, and it feels as though you have access to an entire apartment despite having one floor to yourself. Ryan was the host who was present during my couple days here. He always responded immediately and was very accommodating. The building is really close to the University of Denver station light rail, so it's easy to get around without a car. I highly recommend staying here."
152913,21027425,248474610,2018-03-31,12424057,Curt,"Ashley's place was lovely.  It's been recently remodeled and has many touches to make it feel like a home away from home.  We loved the location, very central to all things Denver, and liked that we could walk to Sloan's lake, Starbucks, a movie theatre, and a brewpub.  It's listed as a two bedroom, but there is a den off of the living room with a sofabed in it and double doors with drapes that really turns it into a three bedroom.  There is even plenty of free street parking.

I wouldn't hesitate at all to stay there again.

Curt"

Considering the unfortunate freezing temperatures, we couldn’t have had a better place to be snowed in at during our stay! Between the fireplace, sauna and wonderful shower, we were at peace with the cold! I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone planning to travel to Denver."
236640,34735974,504371135,2019-08-07,272806220,Douglas,"Heather and co-host Brenda were very responsive, gracious and thoughtful in their communications, and the house was just as described.  Lovely home, tasteful decorations and amenities, comfortable, really perfect for our visit to Denver.  The location/neighborhood was even better.  We were close to everything, from a park and Trader Joe's across the street, several nearby museums, Denver Botanic Gardens (really impressive!), selection of great restaurants in walking distance, bakeries, bagel shops, and more.  No negatives to our time here, would definitely stay here again if we get back to Denver in the future."
19198,3150813,250573898,2018-04-05,171304091,Genevieve,Mark and his home were both great. Mark was very responsive and available for our questions. His home was beautiful and every area was nicely decorated in really unique ways. It was close to food and easy to access with lots of available street parking. Mark kindly provided extra sets of keys for us as well. The patio was lovely too. We hope to be back again!

5704,676825,86791918,2016-07-17,62403312,Tiffany,Krista's house was lovely. This was the simplest reservation I have ever had. we had a group of 5-7 depending on the night and we all fit comfortably. it was to hang out and play cards with friends. We were in town for a soccer tournament and enjoyed our stay. We will definitely stay here again in the future. Thank you for opening your home up to us.
84505,13207841,103477874,2016-09-22,94859405,Brenda,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

My husband and I stayed for just 2 nights but our stay was comfortable, quiet and communication with Maren was excellent. Near to the popular restaurant Linger and and an easy walk to Downtown this place truly is a gem "

Robin greeted us when we got there and showed us the room along with the outdoor space. She showed us some maps and had a list of suggestions for places to eat and visit right on the wall in the room! Just 20 mins to Downtown and you have the awesome Stanley Marketplace that Robin was so generous to suggest for dinner! They have a lovely touch for those who enjoy smoking some ganja at anytime of day! Best part of all, it's VERY private! Private entrance with a great gazebo to enjoy some 420. I can definitely recommend this place to anyone family or friends looking to enjoy Denver!"

65510,9797489,197971100,2017-09-27,30237044,Meredith,"David's place was a nice place for us stay while exploring the Denver area. The only part that was off putting was that there is literally a closed door separating you from the rest of the house, versus it being a separate apartment, so you hear pretty much everything going on upstairs. But besides that, it was clean, the bed was comfortable, the outdoor patio was lovely, and David was very friendly and hospitable!"

137221,19293155,425690923,2019-03-18,175332797,Shannon,"The Sanctuary is aptly named, as you can immediately feel the serenity the space provides the minute you walk through the front door. The flat is a necessary breath of fresh air for anyone who is looking to relax and re-charge in the Denver area. The neighborhood was fantastic, with many places in walking distance, and yet quiet enough to offer a peaceful setting for a vacation or trip. I didn’t want to leave the Sanctuary by the time check-out rolled around, but have plans to return in the near future to get my fix! Thank you Allan for being such a great host and offering such a beautiful place to stay. This space is highly recommended and will not disappoint!"
5800,678602,79388373,2016-06-12,27829303,Carolyn,"Leigh both greeted and was around to see us off. The area was very convenient for us visiting our son in Denver. She made sure we had everything we needed, and was thoughtful about thinking what we might need (even providing extra chairs when she realised we might have some guests). The beds were very comfortable as well. Nicely decorated house. And supplied with all one might need (shampoo, condition, body wash and lotion). Kitchen easy. Lovely little garden out back to have breakfast in, visiting in June. 
Highly recommended!!!"

The back yard garden is beautiful and a great place to chill out. It's super close to downtown Denver and has a ton of restaurants and pubs within walking distance. Sloan' Lake park which was 3 blocks away was an unexpected bonus, another cool place to hang out. The hosts John and Shann were primo, excellent people to have as our hosts.

The downstairs apartment is very clean and new. I'm allergic to dogs, but Javi didn't bother me at all! The host was so accommodating to make sure things were dander-free! I appreciated using a code to enter/leave the house; it's much easier than having to fumble for a key. It was a great stay and I'd highly recommend this place to anyone!"

It has a great work space, eating space and area to watch TV. He had the refrigerator stocked with sparkling water and creamer. A very nice touch.  The coffee was great too!!  He was a fantastic host with his tips for where to go out in the neighborhood. Easy access to Univ of Denver which is why we were there. It is sparkling clean. Like spotless! And very comfortable. Would definitely stay again next time we are in town."

It was the perfect location in between Sloan’s Lake and Mile High stadium which made it quick and easy to get everywhere around town. The whole place was incredibly clean and well set up for AirBNB guests. The roof deck was one of the best parts, with great views of downtown and the mountains, plus a grill which we used to save money on meals. Kyle was always quick to respond to our messages. Next time I’m in Denver I hope to stay at Kyle's again. "

54021,8541446,179495324,2017-08-07,70071659,Natalie,"The house is beautiful! Decorating very comfortably kept neat, yard and outdoor seating area is an absolute gem  - lots of time, care and love put unto home. 

I arrived from a situation at another property that was not ideal for me. I left early and was greeted with fresh water, a turn down service, aromatherapy and a large beautiful space to relax and decompress in. 

Thank you so much!"

2978,142683,466947338,2019-06-09,43076284,Wynter,"This was a nice little townhouse with a good location. The only thing we had complaints about was the AC unit is connected to the owner's other side so when we would try to turn the air up, the owner would turn it down saying her bedroom was freezing and ask us to just open up the windows. The house was 77 degrees and even with windows open we were pretty warm. It was even 59 degrees outside through the night, so I am not sure why our bedrooms were still pretty warm. 

Other than that, cute little house and great host! She was very responsive and quick to answer any issues that we had."

114803,16361274,270903444,2018-05-30,5883058,Emily,"A clean, no fuss place from which to explore Denver! I was in town to visit friends that lived in the same neighborhood, and Robin's place was an easy walk to them and to Tennyson Street (for dining and shops). I did not have a car, but if I did her house would be perfect as there was a lot of on street parking available (as compared to the crowded and narrow adjacent streets). If you desire a large bathroom space this place is not for you (it's narrow), but it fit all my needs exactly!"
46779,7584529,514187063,2019-08-20,128363481,Tierra,"My fiancé and I stayed here for a week and had such an amazing time! this little space was perfect for our stay. It was super close to the art district “RINO”. There are lots of little eateries, breweries and coffee shops near by that are very walkable, public transport is very accessible. Our host was very sweet and cool! They were very accommodating. They gave us lots of tips on where to go and what to do which was great to get the local scoop of the town! Inside the room had a great mini fridge, with snacks inside. It was great to have so we could store some food while we stayed. The access to the room was very easy to get into and the way we knew each other was home was very helpful as well. We absolutely loved this place and hope to come back!"
48778,7843605,178066000,2017-08-04,36951254,Nicholas,Had a good night's stay at Cynthia's apartment. Close to voodoo donuts was a nice surprise!

The room is small, not a ton of room for additional suitcases but the closet is large and the dresser and desk provide great storage.  Charles and Robin were able to suggest great restaurants in the area and things to do.  There is a ton of street parking and the location provides great access to the Denver area.  Thanks again for the great stay!"

We were getting into Denver late and just needed a spot to sleep before our journey further west, and Jess and Wills place was perfect and comfy. Accurate description, clean, and easy to check in made this a great spot!!"

160487,21608586,352095668,2018-11-24,66589937,Kevin,Great location.  Great gym.

73367,11521979,340689669,2018-10-24,46984314,Raleisha,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at Jenna's place for 5 days to explore Denver. It was such a smart decision because the location is prime! Super close to everything, which is what we needed as we decided to forego the car rental and just uber/lyft everywhere. In our case, we actually rarely did because all of the bars, restaurants and downtown is close the location. We actually just rented bird/lime scooters to get around everywhere. (Bird is better IMO) IT WAS SO MUCH FUN! You really get to see more around town by doing that. The place is quiet and private, which is what makes it even more better. Although, it is in DT area, you will brush into a bunch of homeless people in the area. They usually leave you alone. I was a bit wary the first night but we've been scooting/walking everywhere, It didn't bothered me as much. Just know your limits and be aware of your surroundings. 

The place is clean and well maintained. I appreciate how we have our own bathroom area as I have stayed in previous Airbnb's before that had to share bathrooms. Bed is comfortable too! One thing i really enjoyed is that they provide you with a small table fan and heater. I cannot sleep with rotating air, so having this nifty thing is an added bonus! I did not used the heater but it's there for your use if needed. 

As I have mentioned, the location for this airbnb is prime! Definitely stay here if you're looking for a place to stay after exploring DT Denver. It's a walking distance to Work and Class (Literally will take you 5 mins. to walk to it). A restaurant that is SO SO GOOD! Also close to breweries (Ratio, Our mutual friend, The great divide brewery) and Distillery/Winery (Infinite monkey theorem, Mile high). We did Lyft to Stranahan's and Bear Creek Distillery, which is not bad at all. It was a 15-20 mins. walk to Larimer Square and 16th street mall. We did scootered over to Union Station, which was closer than we expected. Overall, this place offers you the best deal in terms of location and price. We definitely enjoyed our stay and hope to be back soon!"
18360,2908978,103467468,2016-09-22,3979503,Merlin,"Had a great stay and felt like at home. 
Rita is a wonderful and caring host.

The room was big enough for me to set up a pack-n-play. Rebecca’s sons were fun and entertaining. The location is quiet but also close to great dining and a local bookstore. I would definitely book here in the future.

The room was so cozy and spotless clean! I loved the little snacks by the night table, and appreciated the extra linen! Thanks again for the hospitality! I will definitely stay again next time I visit Denver (hopefully for a little longer!)."

11948,1622963,107214723,2016-10-09,97842220,Renee,Everything in her descriptions were 100% accurate. The room was perfect for my husband and I and having a private bathroom was wonderful. Tanya was spot on with her suggestions for both food and places to see in Denver. There are great places to eat within a few blocks of her home. The walk into Downtown was beautiful and easy. You can get anywhere in the downtown Denver area with a $5-$10 Uber. We will most definitely stay with Tanya the next time we visit Denver. Book today if it's available. 
57871,8954951,231138498,2018-01-30,5898158,Jake,"Great location in a fun, convenient neighborhood! Ena is a wonderful host and very responsive. The common areas and two main bedrooms are fantastic. Only thing to note is the third bedroom is a full-size futon, which isn't obvious from the listing."
154832,21120569,448985626,2019-05-05,218685076,Nick,"Perfect little space. Everything was very clean and organized. Bed was firm and comfortable (slept well the entire stay) and the mini fridge came in handy. The location is in a great spot if you want to experience both the city and explore the surrounding areas. Only thing i would say is if you are not a dog person this may not be the place for you, other then that we really enjoyed our stay!"

I’m a sucker for cute touches and we were greeted by a “Welcome” note on the refrigerator as well as a special note inside the refrigerator with 2 beers! The booklet full of tips and tricks for Denver was AMAZING! When we couldn’t figure out where we wanted to go for dinner and/or drinks, we opened it up and instantly had so many options! Bonus was the super Joanna Gaines styled bathroom! It was so nice to have a place that felt like home in a city we’d never been to before! I can only hope my next Air BnB experience is as great as this one (my first)!"
193492,25342433,547717125,2019-10-15,23418568,Jolleen,Cute space! Parking was an issue during our stay but the walks around the neighborhood were beautiful so we didn’t mind much.
97251,14593779,439326089,2019-04-18,253570260,Nora,"Chuck and Jordan’s place was great! Everything was just as we expected it or better. It was my first time using Airbnb and they made it simple and convenient for me and my bf. Their place felt like we were home! Also, the hot tub was amazing. After being out exploring/hiking all day, it was nice to come home and relax before going to bed."
242411,37718852,531112176,2019-09-16,76975216,Nicole,"Sarah was really friendly and nice! She was quick to respond and really gave us space to do our thing. The space is completely shared with the rest of the house, so you will hear footsteps and dogs barking, but otherwise, it was a nice space to unwind from exploring the city."

The house is extremely comfortable and well equipped and the rooftop terrace was wonderful for morning coffees and evening wine!

We tended to uber everywhere and it took less than 10 minutes to get to the Capitol building.

All in all, a great airbnb and would definitely recommend wholeheartedly.

If you visit Denver, this is the place to stay!"
223077,31116813,426606507,2019-03-21,162009133,Alix,Anna's place was awesome and I really enjoyed staying here.  She responded quickly to any questions that I had.  The check in process was clear and really easy.  The house is really nice and super clean.  It had everything I needed and was a perfect place to stay during my short visit to Denver.
113070,16172759,165687007,2017-07-01,31089569,Nate,"Such a nice place to stay. Hannah was very accommodating with my schedule and very responsive when I had questions. The location is perfect. I spent most of my time walking where I needed to go and when I couldn't walk, there was Uber and Union Station within reach! The condo was clean and matched the description perfectly. Plenty of room and had everything I needed. I would definitely stay here again!"
231483,33254257,489933231,2019-07-17,125619267,Sally,"Katie was a great host. We discovered that one window didnt lock. We contacted Katie, who responded immediately and was at the house in 15 minutes. She couldn't get the window to open either, so she went to a hardware store, picked up supplies, and came back to fix it herself. She gave amazing local food tips, which is super helpful since my bf and I are vegan. The house was super clean, and there were lots of restaurants, bars, clothing stores, and coffee shops within walking distance. Would 100% recommend to anyone and would stay here again."

Loved getting to know AyJay and would definitely stay there again next time I visit Denver!
222986,31089043,440333631,2019-04-20,75208724,Sarah,"We stayed here as a group of four and this Air BnB exceeded our expectations! The place was amazing — spacious,  clean and bright. Location was exactly where we wanted to be — safe area with tons of restaurants, bars, and shops within walking distance. Downtown is walkable or a quick uber/lyft ride away. We found that parking was very difficult in the area. Very few spots were available and there are restrictions on every street. Other than that, everything was great about our stay. We would absolutely stay here again."

2381,98008,50395077,2015-10-11,5149791,Barbara,"My review can only repeat what others' have written - that this house (home) is a beautifully restored Queen Anne that sends you back to  the turn of the (20th) century - but with modern amenities!  The location lets you walk to nearby terrific restaurants and attractions if you wish, though it's fun just walking around the neighborhood to view other restorations and beautiful front-yard gardens.  Plus, Jim is exceedingly gracious and accommodating.  He will give you tips on things to see and do, and offer directions on the best way to get to them! Plus, he truly means it when he says to make yourself at home.  This is a unique airbnb experience, made possible by Jim's hospitality."

117467,16741454,477715843,2019-06-28,70578061,Daniel Aaron,"Jacob and Morgan's place was idyllic! So many cute touches, it really was easy to feel at home. The Tennyson shops are literally steps away from the place. Tons of great eating spots and shops. And the price was right for the stay! I can't recommend this place enough. If you're thinking about booking this place, do it! You won't regret it."
23198,3760606,106350179,2016-10-05,25561846,Scott,Kodie's place was the perfect place to call home while in Denver. It was the perfect place to relax with a lovely hot tub and a super adorable room.
190216,24846197,335258653,2018-10-11,106742594,Blake,Great location and space. Chris was extremely helpful and responsive when checking in. I would stay here again and recommend to a friend.
35534,5604348,495933839,2019-07-26,244792459,Lisa,Brandon and Robert’s place is so cozy we often had a hard time leaving in the morning. The bed is so comfy and we were able to make coffee every morning. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in Denver!

7793,852934,15686119,2014-07-14,5404984,Judy,"Tom was an exceptionally welcoming & attentive host (& a talented artist!).  He set up the private kitchen for our breakfast, providing everything we could want.  The neighborhood was quiet & accessible to a nearby trail for running or biking.  The space is a basement, so it felt a bit stuffy (windows did not open) & a bit quirky (the bathroom is off a narrow twisting corridor, the kitchen does not have running water).  However, the space worked well for us & we would stay there again."

21711,3487191,145735712,2017-04-19,65822962,Mary Grace,"I have nothing but good words for Nathen. He is very approachable and warm. He gives you privacy yet if you need anything he is just one message away and he lives infront of the house too. Bed and couch are very comfortable. towels are plenty and very clean. He provided beers ,water, fee chocolates and coffee. the neighborhood is quiet and relaxing, If you rent a car you have your own parking at the back. His place is near cherry creek mall and 16th street mall. a small patio outside for smoking cigarette. all in all we will definitely be back! One of the best stays we had in our US vacation. "

110839,16026347,522906996,2019-09-02,26206451,Courtney,Tamara and Michael had a great place! The stylish decor and personal touches made their place so welcoming!
112495,16159967,529389285,2019-09-14,135667823,Lyndi,Mark was a quick communicator and when we asked for extra sheets so a friend could sleep on the couch he had them sent over. The location is great and walking distance to everything.
149742,20831478,430097125,2019-03-29,14103501,Francisco,"Josh was very responsive.  The house had great amenities to keep the group entertained during our stay.  Also, the Safeway across the street was very convenient and the lake park within 1 1/4 mile was great."

67145,10248217,149921688,2017-05-06,119348785,Kelly,"Home was exactly as described. Location is great. Restaurants, coffee shops, playground, bookstores, and grocery store are all within walking distance. Easy access to the highway to get downtown or head out toward the mountains. Check in/out was easy, and Emily could be reached throughout the week (though nothing went wrong in our case, so it wasn't even necessary). Great stay!"
139872,19589877,445150535,2019-04-28,55595842,Brianna,"Highly recommend this beautiful home. The neighborhood is gorgeous and the hosts are beyond thorough with tips, information, and amenities! It’s a peaceful spot to unwind after a day of work or adventure."

88202,13560410,250609600,2018-04-05,88790899,Meagan,The place is quite comfortable and is perfect for a couple. It is walking distance to a few restaurants for a quick bite. Matt was a great host and offered suggestions of things to do in the area.
123601,17388640,513596494,2019-08-19,277495381,Murray,Thanks so much for such a well organised stay! You had so many little touches here and there for an effortless checkin and out
64926,9731001,528190981,2019-09-12,178540731,Jill,"This was a nice, simple space with a great private bathroom. There are young children in the house so it's not necessarily idea for the light sleeper who may want to sleep in, but the hostess is very friendly and it was a good stopover point from the airport."
154464,21080559,491734587,2019-07-20,91565413,Ryan,Brad's place was a great place for 3 of us to crash after a local concert.

161228,21667826,476672769,2019-06-26,20698557,Brian,"Simon & Aurora's place is impeccably clean and comfortable. The bed was comfy and huge! What stood out the most was the little touches - they left a 6 pack of various tasty local beers in the fridge, sample jars of local coffee beans, and even extra toothbrushes+toothpaste which happened to be exactly what we needed. Their home is within walking distance (or scooter distance) to all the cool spots in RiNo. Simon & Aurora were very quick to respond and helped make our stay in Denver very fun! 5/5 stars for sure!"
76671,12288253,204345666,2017-10-17,32393182,Tessa,"Lauren and Squash were the best hosts imaginable, and absolutely exceeded our expectations in every way. We had such a wonderful time throughout our stay with Lauren and will DEFINITELY stay again in the future!

107196,15674568,284611402,2018-07-01,63427352,Rachael,"Fantastic spot. Secluded but close to downtown. I came into town for a conference at the Colorado Convention Center and this was perfect for me. All the pictures are accurate. Very nice furnishings with coffee/coffee filters, etc.. Sometimes it is the little things that make a big difference! Full functioning kitchen was great. Bed is comfortable with a great fan above it. I definitely recommend for anyone planning on spending time in the Denver area!"
59035,9108143,140975397,2017-04-01,75861241,Jeff,"Exactly as described/pictured. Had everything you could need, really enjoyed it"
157428,21292890,535596607,2019-09-24,276310768,Diana,"The pictures don't do justice! Such a beautiful and clean place. We felt right at home!
I appreciated how fast Andrea replied to my messages and how accommodating she was.
I typically enjoyed the coffee maker and the cute greeting on the blackboard. If you forget shampoo or conditioner DON'T WORRY Andrea has got you covered! I would definitely recommend this place  you're only 2 blocks away from great breweries and restaurants"
42010,6869896,174997410,2017-07-27,35853205,Alexander,Simply put as advertised great stay Billy is a super host

111204,16054644,292741356,2018-07-18,120571858,Dane,"Josh's place is great. Comfortable living space, beautiful kitchen, lovely little backyard. Everything is spotless and it was the perfect size for three friends."
67021,10237203,473428699,2019-06-21,77945,Kim,"Jess's space is really cozy and cute. It's in a convenient neighborhood, with tons of historic charm. Street parking was easy, as was self-check-in. It has a great shower with a ton of hot water. As mentioned elsewhere, there was occasional noise from upstairs, but during reasonable hours. We found it to be a really good home base for our short stay in Denver, and we'd stay here again."
87572,13494205,248490106,2018-03-31,108737906,Tarren,"David is a great host and I really appreciate his hospitality, and the thought and time that he has put into his home. He has others in mind and you can tell this immediately when you walk through the doors. The amenities are great, and the artwork throughout his home is unique and unmatched. Staying in this home definitely made my trip to Denver worthwhile. I felt sad when I walked out the door for the last time but I promise you will not be disappointed if you stay here, I will definitely be coming back."
62171,9486988,73405559,2016-05-08,2421882,Kayla,"Eliza's house was super cute and in the perfect location for what we needed. We were familiar with the neighborhood, but there are lots of amenities within walking distance if you're not. We used the upstairs king bed and the basement queen and both beds were comfortable. The check in and out procedure was super easy and we had a great time! "
105218,15471561,230687517,2018-01-28,158974334,Mindi,Great choice for our stay. Three couples traveled by for work and it could not have worked out better. Would also be a great choice for a family stay. First Air BNB experience for us and it was 5 star.
33737,5347637,229819648,2018-01-25,14683462,Jaime,Great place to crash for a few nights. Nice peaceful neighborhood. Host is very nice and responds promptly.
73251,11521979,132227353,2017-02-16,44274733,Noah,"Really enjoyed my stay at Jenna's place! Fantastic location with lots of breweries, restaurants, and sightseeing nearby and a great, comfortable place to relax after a day around town."
149876,20832904,249170409,2018-04-01,18066905,Rebecca,"Alma was a wonderful hostess and very thoughtful! The space itself was breathtaking and it was so easy to access downtown, freeways, and restaurants. It is about 15 minutes driving from anything we wanted to access. The room was also fantastic and looks even better in person. I especially loved the shower head, which was so lovely in the mornings. We will definitely be back!"
160166,21591739,234139808,2018-02-11,136600345,Jennifer,Close to everything ! Loved my stay and will definitely be returning

137168,19293155,291388590,2018-07-15,164712741,Michelle,"Thanks so much for giving us the opportunity to stay in your wonderful place!  It was modern, super clean and comfy!  The location worked out well for us and we appreciated all the local tips.   Would highly recommend staying there and will be back next time we visit our son.  Cheers! "
116025,16548314,493498811,2019-07-22,76633558,Kristi,This was the perfect place for our little family to stay on our vacation to Denver! The location is outstanding. The cottage itself is full of charm and has a unique vibe. We really enjoyed ourselves and felt at home.
101863,15094515,251286895,2018-04-07,171353123,Tony,"Stayed for 2 nights in April - the apartment was a perfect base camp for exploring the mountains and the city centre alike.

We checked in slightly early and the apartment was clean and ready to go. There were some good bars nearby and ample takeaway options if you just want to relax after a day of exploring Denver.

Would definitely recommend!"
207736,27868894,499613027,2019-07-31,260742894,Karen,"You will fall in love with Maxie and the place right as you walk in. It is a lovely space. The bed is super comfy and bedroom and living area are super spacious. Location is great, everything is so close by, and we tried Sunrise Sunset Restaurant and was some of the best breakfast we had. 10/10 recommend staying here"
59749,9169151,70876949,2016-04-21,34399553,Katie,Awesome place to stay. Looks like the pictures. Good light inside the space. Cute and safe neighborhood. Close enough to downtown without the downtown traffic.  
117235,16733876,250304509,2018-04-04,104870116,Katie,Cozy and had everything we needed
148526,20695085,535066733,2019-09-23,22324678,Pablo,"I traveled to Denver with my wife and my almost two year old boy. We booked Megan’s house because it seemed like a good place to rest after full days of exploring the city and surrounding areas. We were delighted to have found this place which is without a doubt the cleanest AirBnB we have ever stayed at. This little basement apartment is simple and thoughtfully equipped with everything necessary which makes it a toddler friendly and safe space. It is located in a beautiful and calm neighborhood just under 20 minutes from the airport and downtown areas. Megan is a great host, she checked with us couple of times to make sure we were well set up for our stay. I will definitely recommend this place to any couple or small family visiting the area."
191756,25084283,531976737,2019-09-18,53345830,Kourtney,"My fiancé and his friends absolutely loved Jessica’s place. Great location, very clean, comfortable, and “homey.” We booked same day. Jessica was great with communicating!"
35502,5604348,401477194,2019-01-14,231298912,Dan,Everything was exactly as advertised. All of my messages were answered quickly. They bent over backwards to make my stay as nice as possible.
126411,17927914,368970965,2019-01-08,126670360,Emily,Great location nice views beautiful apartment.
104162,15344781,113262664,2016-11-11,29869399,Emma,Linda was great. She met us at the door and was very friendly. Had clean towels and a mini fridge stocked with milk and water ready. Place is exactly as advertised with airport access within 20 minutes. Would definitely stay again 
212742,28931478,438000274,2019-04-15,28406691,Julia,"Robert's place was very tidy and great for a family of five (four adults, a baby, and our pup) to spend a weekend together. There was plenty of space for all of us and we were able to cook a few meals together comfortably. And as a Denver local, I'll say that you can't beat the location—it's steps from my favorite park in the city and a nice walk or a very short drive from some great coffee shops, bars and restaurants.

It's also worth mentioning our unit had apparently been double-booked. Partway through our stay, another guest showed up who said he had booked through (Hidden by Airbnb) . I'm not clear on how Robert was able to resolve the issue with the other guest, but the other guest was very nice and left us be. Upon my request, Robert did let me know a few hours later that he had changed the other guest's access code."
152631,21024630,283339590,2018-06-29,179269446,Sonia,"Very quaint little room for one or two people. Room was a bit dark due to keeping all the drapes closed because no air conditioning but does have nice fan for circulation. Neighborhood close to many Denver attractions. 
Communication with Jay and Robin was exceptional"
206285,27633691,365667984,2019-01-01,43424400,Katie,"Beautiful apartment-like guest suite. Modern and well decorated with fluffy towels, comfy bed, and delicious coffee. Close to Broadway shops, restaurants, breweries and super accessible to all areas of Denver. Some noise from living area above, but didn't affect us much. Shared entry area. Overall a wonderful stay with a really responsive, thoughtful host. Highly recommend."
206701,27702373,460641202,2019-05-29,215468876,Vanessa,"When staying at the lofts, do not leave the ceiling fan on. It pushes the hot air down. Open all windows and turn the AC on. It got very hot our first night but otherwise, it was a great stay. Near downtown area"
65859,9883770,499559489,2019-07-31,32993043,Laural,This is the best value in Denver! What a gem. So spacious and in a super convenient location. It was excellent for my husband and I and 2 teens. Sarah is a great host too! We loved the extra room to spread out and relax.
108029,15787181,160149214,2017-06-12,130485932,Katherine,"We had a lovely stay in Shannon's cozy quarters. Lots of little touches around the house that made us feel right at home. She was very helpful when we asked for recommendations for things to see and do, and her cat is aDORable. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."
140616,19671778,359691832,2018-12-17,56455423,Clara,Great place to stay. Fast responses and very easy check in. Only thing I would note is that the bed is VERY firm so if you prefer a softer mattress this might not be the place for you.
26280,4191778,76723838,2016-05-29,31962493,Christina,"Erin's place is just amazing. Her parents, Judy and Mike, could not be more attentive. They looked after us so well, offered tours and took us to the grocery store. We'd also get surprise muffins every few days! The flat is also only a short walk away from great stretch of Broadway with lovely restaurants and bars. 

Great price, great location, great hosts. In fact, we'll be going back very soon!"
1985,81540,46264664,2015-09-09,31792443,Cody,Enjoyed staying in a residential area rather than in a big hotel or something. The location was close enough to everything without being in the cluttered downtown area. Favorite food nearby was Beau Jo's pizza. 
81174,12986223,520021563,2019-08-29,87451837,Denise,"Brian's place is spotless, has great amenities (coffee, creamers in the fridge, plenty of towels, a list of local restaurants, and an AMAZING shower with the pressure is off the charts!), comfortable bed, perfect air conditioning, in a safe neighborhood, and is located across the street from the best park/bike path in Denver! The 2.5-mile walk around the lake is scenic and such a nice way to begin your day! Walk 3/4 of the way around and you will land at Starbucks and Dunkin! Pick a drink up for the rest of the walk home! Plus, his house is conveniently located near the major highway so it's easy on/off to all places in and around Denver. 

One thing that attracted us to Brian's place is that we were the only people in the house. It's so awkward when the owners are home while you're there. 

We were glad to see that there is an easy combination lock to the door to get in. No worry about losing keys!

Brian had excellent communication before and during our stay. Not many Airbnb owners are as prompt in responses to emails. 

We can't recommend Brian's place high enough. Highly suggest staying here if it's comfort, convenience and good value for your money that you are looking for!"
120180,17044680,554554572,2019-10-26,42315422,Rebecca,"Exactly as advertised: a stylish, well-appointed suite (bedroom, bathroom, small balcony, big closet) on the top floor of a quiet building. Loved the thoughtful touches, like already-plugged-in chargers for both iPhone and Android, and the fancy shower (though we never did figure out how to get the four lower sprays to work). The kitchen and living room, shared with two? other units, are two floors down. Both were clean and tidy, although the kitchen needed a firm organizing hand in my view (soy-sauce packets in with the silverware, etc.). The shared aspect was a little awkward — the people in another unit used all the glasses and put them in the dishwasher, but it was I who, the next day, actually ran the dishwasher and put all the dishes away. (All we’d used were two mugs.) But this is a small quibble. We loved the space, and the hosts’ responsiveness when AirBNB technology temporarily failed us (the app refused to update when we arrived in Denver, so we couldn’t see the check-in instructions). We highly recommend this suite."
84077,13189674,309704315,2018-08-18,3876236,Sarah,"Perfect spot for 2! My husband and I stayed here for a long weekend and it was just great. The apt. was very clean, parking on the street was never a problem, the neighborhood was quiet, and it was nearby to a beautiful park and some cute coffee spots (although we did not have time to take advantage). We very much enjoyed our stay here in Denver and would definitely look to stay again on another visit."
217977,29755398,457710073,2019-05-24,14212487,Caleb,"Rachel’s place was lovely, clean, and in a great location.  Checkin was also a breeze, and it had all the amenities of home. 

I would definitely recommend a stay!"
68384,10494162,195542368,2017-09-19,138317057,Diane,Location close to downtown area. The cottage was nice but there are no breakfast or food items at all. All other amenities were provided. A washing machine and dryer are available for 1.00 per load. The neighborhood pub was fun. I don't recommend a lot of walking in the area - best to do that downtown.
242358,37684648,540031990,2019-10-02,269372710,Jay,"Great space, clean, good off street parking and convenient location.  Peter was easy to communicate with and responsive.  I look forward to staying there again."
201398,26639298,362607113,2018-12-26,48790368,Peggy,This lovely townhouse is located near City Park and the zoo in Denver.  The hosts are really good at communicating with your needs.  I was able to make all of my meals in the nice kitchen.  I would highly recommend this Air Bnb.

The listing was very nice, clean, and secure.

Couldn't recommend more."

120341,17072188,415815778,2019-02-23,61883248,Erika,"The apartment was very clean and nicely decorated. I was very cozy on the comfy couch watching Netflix during my down time. The kitchen would have been great had I decided to cook but there were too many great restaurants nearby to think about that! So many thoughtful amenities, like a hairdryer and feminine products. Also the washer and dryer came in handy! Overall, highly recommend.
Great location in a quiet neighborhood and close to the restaurant I really wanted to visit (Vert Kitchen). I also visited the 5 Star Salt Caves while there."

180036,23642743,429370671,2019-03-27,21525529,Jenny,"A little rough round the edges but fine for a short stay, comfy beds, clean bathroom, in a good location not too far from downtown and other attractions.  It was pretty easy to take the bus into the city too.  As others have said, pretty much everything is audible from the apartment upstairs, and you have no control over the heat - except via a portable heater.  Jim left us to our own devices which was fine.  Would stay again."
136835,19207597,473428812,2019-06-21,259663288,Kathy,"Great place to stay and convenient  to downtown Denver. Able to walk to fun places and good restaurants on Tennyson Street. Everything you need for a comfortable stay plus a private roof top porch deck. 
Private one car garage removed the anxiety of finding a parking space on city streets, however,  reconfirm you confirm that your vehicle is not too large to fit into the space.  Would definitely rent Ben’s place again without hesitation."
178204,23439093,255516216,2018-04-20,7591042,Peter,The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

6499,760023,13039984,2014-05-18,14138231,Melanie,"Jill and Michael were wonderful hosts. They were welcoming and accommodating, going above and beyond my expectations! The neighborhood was awesome, very pedestrian-friendly with lots of great, locally owned and operated places to eat and drink. From their house, it was an enjoyable walk to downtown area, and a cheap cab ride back at night. I would definitely recommend Jill and Michael to family and friends!!"
50002,7931953,132865013,2017-02-19,63063290,Monica,"Our stay was great, it's near many restaurants at a walking distance, there is a delicious Mexican bakery around the corner we had delicious sweet bread. Kimberly's restaurant recommendations were great but I would suggest making reservations in advanced or else wait 2-3 hours for a table (we were a group of 5).

The place is just as described, beds were comfortable. The only minor thing was that it was very noisy at around 6am from the neighbors, and there is no tv, I don't know if the noise is a daily thing or only just this morning. Other than that our stay was very enjoyable.       "
191864,25136700,466882076,2019-06-09,137735293,Rainelee,Great stay! Very accommodating and awesome stay. Modern & rustic. Main level is warmer than lower level for whoever gets cold easily. It’s to be expected as the lower level is the basement.
7732,834896,32816134,2015-05-22,18113126,Phi,Nan was a fantastic host! Everything was laid out nicely and she did everything she could to make our first Denver experience enjoyable. The house itself was extremely private and tucked away. If you get a chance to stay you'll realize how close everything is to you!  
108221,15788708,422212880,2019-03-10,22011845,Daryl,This quirky mansion is located in a nice area with quick access to the bar scene. It’s clean with plenty of bedrooms. The first floor bathroom shower is subpar though

69688,11037671,81204182,2016-06-21,59505857,Jessica," Jack's place was perfect for my stay with my husband in Denver. It was spacious, with plenty of room for the two of us. It was quiet, peaceful, very close to downtown, and Jack was very hospitable. I'd recommend Jack's place to anyone looking for a quiet, comfortable, convenient, 420-friendly place to stay. I'd definitely stay again. "

We had a late flight so we got in after Midnight but Sarah made it so pain free to gain access to our condo. Once inside we were taking back by the cleanliness and special touches. We stay 8 days and was so nice from the neighbors to the location. We felt right at home. This was our first Air bnb experience and loved every minute of it!! 
Thank You Sarah for everything!!!"

His home is in a great location, in fact we walked back from downtown after the concert because Lyft was going to take too long and it was a very pleasant walk. We only stayed for one night, and were often out of the house exploring as much of downtown Denver as possible, but the bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom featured a gorgeous claw foot tub."
55859,8721578,105177171,2016-09-30,3229160,Joon,"Stephanie and Christoph were very welcome and make me feel like home.

The place was properly cleaned before we arrived and the keypad check-in was extremely easy. Everything you would need was there: coffee/tea, water, towels, toiletries, etc. The location was great, just a short uber/lyft ride away from downtown and walking distance from most places on Broadway. Did not get to meet Nathen but he was responsive over messages/text which was perfect. Nathen was accommodating for early check-in and late check-out as well. Overall great place and host, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. I will be staying here again for sure!"

But I also used Lyft daily without any trouble. There was always a driver within 2-3 minutes. I only met My host once briefly, but she was helpful and personable. The bathroom is private for the guest, but downstairs from the room so be prepared to go downstairs if you need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. The place itself has been updated with trendy bathroom and kitchen. Great use of art and color in the home. I’d recommend staying here if you want to be on the go in Denver. "

Great location, and a welcoming host, but then the room itself is packed with goodies! There’s a TV, mini-fridge, bathroom, lounge chair, speaker, and swords on the walls. What more could you ask for?"

167473,22231253,302470170,2018-08-05,33112861,Rachel,"Dan and Emily were great hosts! Their apartment was clean, minimalist, and comfortable. The location is great for exploring downtown Denver while still feeling safe. The space is a little tight for five and really would be best for two pairs of people, depending on the family and whether they mind sharing beds. BUT those beds were very comfortable! 

 "
233151,33613259,555363540,2019-10-27,3730209,Amy,Great space and Chris was prompt in all communications. The apartment was sparkling clean and well furnished.

2497,98014,721904,2011-11-15,396041,Suse,"Lindsey and Jim are both awesome hosts. They made me feel incredibly welcome after I landed on their doorstep from the other side of the world and stayed for two weeks. 

The house was lovely, but the best thing was the people, and just how accommodating and lovely Lindsey (in particular) was. I cannot speak highly enough about the experience, and have already recommended that some friends get in contact with her when they have relatives coming to stay. "
54103,8555795,319552975,2018-09-06,206735013,Michael,"Marks place was 10/10. Very laid back atmosphere, mark was great with recommendations and Elvis was great as well. I recommend staying here to any and all. Short drive downtown and a dispensary on almost every corner on the way. He has a giant AC vent right next to the bed which kept the entire room cool for the full stay. Had a great experience!"

Listy had included a binder with any/all information you could possibly need, including information about the area and local restaurants, TV channels, and how to use the heater. It may sound silly, but all these thoughtful details made our stay a breeze. Everything worked out great."

38000,6141491,92087765,2016-08-07,82953501,Joe,"Brian was very accommodating. Nearby cherry creek trails are great and allow a nice 1 mile walk to Glendale City Set Restaurants. Neighborhood is quiet for the most part, however, yards are small and you will hear dogs barking at night and in the morning, we didn't mind but some may. House has a nice patio and outdoor space where we ate several meals. "
89822,13746714,110358986,2016-10-25,9597559,Elvis,"Let me start of by saying that Paul was an amazing host during our entire stay.  When we arrived in Denver, he not only provided us with directions to the house, but even volunteered to pick us up from the train station.  He welcomed us with open arms and showed us around his beautiful home.  The listing was as advertised, but has to be seen in person to be truly appreciated.  Thank you for making our stay in Denver one that we will not forget anytime soon!  "
124936,17606274,201668687,2017-10-08,15176713,Jordan,"What a great place to stay: beautiful, clean room - Carol's proprietary fragrance also made it smell great! - with a big, comfortable bed. Had everything I could need: iron, ironing board, mini fridge, microwave, and most importantly, coffee maker.

I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Carol herself was as nice as can be, and she was totally communicative. Next time I come back to Denver, I'm definitely staying here."

Jen and Zach were super accommodating with our last minute reservation and our last minute request for late check out due to illness. We walked to the near by pizza place Blue Pan and the ice cream place across the street from there for dessert. We would definitely stay here again!

Elizabeth was very welcoming and accessible.  
The unit was spotless and well appointed.  The listing description was very accurate.  The kitchen was very well equipped with stove, microwave, fridge, coffee maker and all the utensils one could need.  The bathroom was neat and also well stocked.  
The home was in a nice neighborhood and I felt safe walking around the area.  It was a good walk from the conference center downtown but I welcomed the exercise. 
Denver is terrific!
I recommend this apartment without reservations."

But we didn't know that there were several other people living sharing the house with Jacob and Jessica. One of them ate from our bowl of ice cream, which was not that appreciated.."

We arrived to the city before our check in time and they let us drop our bags early and even had snacks waiting when we arrived! Their house was beautiful and within walking distance from the train, so being new to the city, that really helped us out. Their pets Marlow and Hudson were really friendly and awesome to hang out with too. Overall we had a really great experience. :)"

184769,24161341,433465777,2019-04-06,8514197,Michael,"What a great space! You'll have a nice bedroom, sitting room and deck area all to yourself.  The hosts are extremely friendly and accommodating, but your space is very private if you would like. They reside primarily on the other side of the house so it feels very much like your own space.  Clean and comfortable, I would definitely recommend a stay with Kerry and Ray!"

118283,16855990,220514814,2017-12-22,36999908,Virup,"Ashley was just stellar with her communication and always ready to help with any doubts or questions I could possibly have. The place was spotless as far as I could tell with in-unit laundry! (no coins or anything) The kitchen had more equipment than I've ever used -- it was such a shame we didn't cook or bake anything! Ashley took the time with the little touches, providing bars, snacks, and tea along with quality soaps and a scented candle in the bathroom. It's just all-around apparent that Ashley put time and care into making our visit as comfortable as possible and even accommodated us as we were getting late during check-out. Would love to stay here again!"
113005,16165056,342911480,2018-10-29,44609186,Jennifer,"Kelsey was a great host! Although, I didn't get to meet her in person, she was very responsive through text. I landed in Denver earlier than the check in time, but she was very accommodating, and I was able to check in early. 

The check in process was very quick and easy. Her directions were easy to follow and there is no need to worry about keys! Snacks were provided and she also made us muffins for breakfast. Her house is very clean and welcoming. A sweet dog also resides there. He's a gentle giant and we enjoyed his company, but if you're not a fan of dogs or are allergic, I'd suggest finding a different place.

We didn't rent a car, but downtown was a short Uber/Lyft ride away. I would definitely stay here again."

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here;  it had everything we needed for the two plus weeks we lived there.   The host family made us feel welcome the day we arrived by giving us a tour of the house and providing us with some extra helpful, useful items.  They gave us ideas on restaurants and shops.  The House was secure and quiet, the neighborhood safe and friendly, the weather cold and sunny.  And we had a White Christmas!  Perfect!  "

52325,8372001,97117174,2016-08-26,78178401,B,"This home was EXACTLY as pictured.  The room is spacious and the additional room off of the bedroom was nice to have and be able to spread out our luggage.  The bathroom was exceptionally clean and the marble tile gleamed - literally.  The rest of the house was clean as well, although we really didn't spend much time there since we made the most of our time in Denver and headed out early.  The location is very convenient to restaurants and nightlife such as Recess and Linger (recommend both).  
Emma kept in touch regarding our requests and questions and was very responsive.  Would not hesitate to stay here again when we return in a couple of months.  
This was our first Airbnb stay and glad it worked out so well.  "

At night I could park right out front, but during the day I had to park three blocks away. Sarah was super attentive and went out of her way to make sure everything was perfect."

Matthew and Patrick also had great recommendation for places to dine and drink upon request. Overall, really comfortable, peaceful and enjoyable stay. - Thanks!"

43080,7047991,85757398,2016-07-13,6510569,Mary,"Christiaan is a great communicator and a friendly guy. I stayed with him for a few nights and he was super flexible. I changed my check-in time on him because of airline strugs and he was chill about meeting me at a new time to get the key. Upon my arrival, he immediately gave me the wifi info, the key, and the door code. Basically, everything I needed. 

The neighborhood is great - central, safe, and walking distance to tons of cool stuff. It's also near bikeshare and public transit, so you have great options that allow you to get around.

The listing is super accurate. Christiaan points out the pros and cons (awesome location, but no shower and a small room in a basement). It was just what I needed at a great price, but if you're looking for a fancy place to stay, this is not it. If you're a budget-minded traveler looking for a place to crash, this is an awesome place. 

That said, Christiaan makes sure that all the little things are there. He provided a lovely thick towel, filtered water, 2-ply toilet paper, and a few other small details that made my stay more pleasant. It's clear that he thinks about the guest experience. "
128925,18273308,166855632,2017-07-04,6859617,Claire,"Parkside was the perfect place for our stay in Denver! The basement apartment was so cute and stayed cool in the summertime heat. The bathroom was spacious and clean, great water pressure, and so nice to have a washer and dryer on hand. The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe and still central, although we did feel the need to take a Lyft or drive everywhere we went in the city. Street parking was busy but we always found a spot close to the house. 
Minka was an excellent host. As we were in town visiting a friend, we mostly kept to ourselves, and Minka gave us our space but was available to offer help and chat as needed. She also provided snacks and helpful menus/guides which were much appreciated. I only wish we had traveled with another friend or two so we could have enjoyed this sweet spot even more!"

She was very willing to share her plethora of ideas of places to try and was spot on! She was very personable and accommodating, her house was lovely, great room and private bathroom. We were welcome to come and go as we pleased.  We would love to come back and stay with Jill! "
182137,23891608,258728057,2018-04-29,74394509,John,"Pros: The place has a great location you can walk up the road to Colfax, it’s literally next door to the grocery store and across the street from a coffee shop. We walked to the closest dispensary around (it was a 13 min walk) but I would recommend other dispensaries in town. The apartment is very spacious. The balcony is a great amenity and the building has a hot tub. They seem like a friendly couple. 

Cons: Booked a month in advance but it took a few weeks to get a response. Asked if it was okay that we would have a late check-in they said it would be alright. They told us to contact a half hour before we arrived or when we landed. When we landed I messaged and when we arrived to the apartment no one was answering messages or calls. The voicemail said a different name than the listing. Luckily, after waiting outside a while (it was after midnight) someone else that lived in the building just happened to show up and let us into the building. We got to the apartment and it was unlocked. Finally some guy called us back at like 2am, dude was at the club, music bumping in the back asking if we got in okay. The next day the host messaged me back on Airbnb and said she fell asleep.
 
Has a designated parking spot but I don’t know which one it was.
I don’t know if everyone gets a welcome present but we didn’t get a Starbucks gift card or a preroll like in the picture listed.
Few broken blinds in living room and a few in the bed room. The sun shines right on you in the morning. 

I don’t let the bads overweigh the goods. I’d give it a 7 out of 10 or 3 out of 5."
976,31503,452215652,2019-05-12,65961181,Lauren,Rick's place was so clean and nice! We enjoyed our stay and the location was a good launch point for so many of our activities!
81421,12990793,259305421,2018-05-01,13600651,Jennalise,"Patricia’s place was awesome! It’s the top floor in a beautiful brownstone. Although the bedroom, bathroom and living room each have separate doors that go out to the main hallway, we felt like we had plenty of privacy. The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom is gorgeous- a jacuzzi tub and lots of windows. The neighborhood is beautiful and a short walk from RiNo which was so much fun - we especially enjoyed Denver Central Market!"
10902,1313699,6078270,2013-07-29,7149662,Michele,"Great house, but an even better host!  We had a group sporting event in town and needed a place to stay and to gather.  The house was perfect for us.  Ann was very kind and loaned our group extra supplies we needed for our weekend and allowed us to stay just a bit longer than check-out in order to get cleaned up before our flights.  I would highly recommend the house and the experience.  Thanks, Ann!  "

Jaclyn was incredibly accommodating and kind to us.  Our stay was comfortable.  She also saved us a ton of money as rates were over $600 for even the cheapest of hotels in the area due to a large event in Denver.  THANK YOU JACLYN!

Just a heads up to future guests, this is definitely a house where a dog lives, could be an issue for anyone with allergies.  Also, there's a good amount of stairs to each bedroom.  Something I didnt take into account as I have rheumatoid arthritis.  Nonetheless, we really enjoyed our stay.  Thanks Will!"

Perfectly located just an easy walk (or quick scooter ride) from downtown, this Uptown apartment is VERY cute and comfortable!  Lots of great places to eat (Las Delicias HIGHLY recommended!!) and a Safeway just a couple blocks away.  Very quiet building and seems like a nice, friendly community.  Easy check-in, and it was nice to have some pantry items available for cooking in.  Bed was super-comfy, and sofa great for a lazy afternoon nap!  Todd was super helpful (and proactive) in working out a slight scheduling snafu and we really appreciated the extra effort so we didn’t have to move locations for our last night in town.   We loved our experience so much we’ve booked his place in Waikiki for our 25th Anniversary trip to Hawaii next month!   Highly recommend this space (and Todd as a super-host)!"

It is so very conveniently located in the midst of a plethora of options to excite all your senses, sight and taste especially. Not only can you find beautiful street art and great food just around the corner, but Ryan & Tina provide you a book full of all the local restaurants menus. The place itself is very clean, there's a lot of attention to detail that goes into the place and it really shows. It's modern, sleek, and inviting. Tina was extremely accommodating and friendly and made sure to constantly check up on us and how our stay was going. I truly appreciate the care and effort that goes into creating this whole experience."
107599,15746223,435159525,2019-04-09,241796804,Celene,"The place is a little small but has everything you need. The shower and toilet are separate. The neighborhood was a little rough, but there were no incidents. The parking situation was alright, we had to park further away from the house on the first day because of all the cars that were parked on the street, but that could've been because it was the weekend.  We were four people total, so we needed both the queen-sized bed and the pull-out couch. There was a small incident with the pull-out couch being stuck and not comfortable, but Eva replied to my message right away, made sure we were comfortable and fixed the issue right away. She is an amazing host!"

Their home is a renovation show piece in the older part of Denver with tree lined street and character for days.  The home is beautiful.  The room I stayed in is essentially all of the basement.  It’s cool and quiet and I had the stairway and a side door of the house to myself.  
I was very impressed and would gladly stay again."

213561,29054370,458909633,2019-05-26,172021630,Jenna,"I loved the space! Kristen made check in super easy for us, let us know about parking (which was easy and important to us), gave great recommendations, and were wonderful at communicating with us. The space was decorated beautifully and the location was great. The park across the street was nice to walk around and the view of mile high from the apartment was so cool!"

We loved the location and were very impressed with the personal touches Ryan has added to the condo.  The beds were comfortable, linens were cleaned and instructions were laid out perfectly.  Thanks again for accommodating our date change and being so quick to respond to questions / inquiries!  We will definitely be staying with Ryan again!"
111873,16087887,256805787,2018-04-23,93203465,Devin,"Nice little place outside of Denver. About a 15 minute drive from downtown, about a $12 uber ride can walk to a 7-11 and sports bar, Milo's."

185489,24245200,526882223,2019-09-09,26531362,Andrew,"My wife and I spent a week at the Carriage House for our honeymoon and loved it. East Colfax Avenue has a ton of fantastic bars, eateries and other activities. This was the perfect base camp for exploring Denver. There is easy access to Lyft and Uber as well as the (much more fun option) scooters that are all over the city. We could be downtown or in other fun areas in less than half an hour easily. The best places we found were within walking distance.

Communication with James and Hanh was excellent for the little we needed during our trip. Check in was quick and simple and we only heard from the hosts when we wanted to. The privacy was excellent being completely separate from the house with a separate entrance. My initial concerns of being above the garage were warrantless as I didn’t notice the garage door opening hardly at all and it certainly did not wake us up in the mornings.

Parking was relatively simple during the trip. We never had to walk far, although it is a relatively packed residential parking area. The furthest we had to walk was about a block. It is worth mentioning that we visited during street sweeping week so there were a couple days where parking was limited to half of the street. This is only two days out of the month though so I wouldn’t find it a deciding factor for booking this location.

If I had to make a complaint it would be regarding furniture. This is pretty minor, but the mattresses were far less than comfortable. If I was only staying a couple nights this would not be a big issue at all but by the end of the week we were definitely ready for a better bed. That being said, everything else was so great I would still stay here again. The couch was a bit small and lacking in comfort and lounge space but we were having so much fun out and about in the city that it was hardly an issue. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place. The location, cleanliness and style were all awesome. We will definitely consider this for future trips to Denver and would encourage everyone else to consider it as well. The distance to East Colfax and all it has to offer makes it a fantastic value."

Thoughtful touches, including random food bits and plenty of wonderful books to read! I enjoyed one from their selection so much that I finished it in one night.

My bedroom was downstairs and very quiet. I was welcome to use the kitchen and even received a lemon cucumber from the garden that I had never seen before. Everything was nearby from this Airbnb, so this was very convenient and free parking in the street."

Megan was extremely helpful and accommodating. We appreciated the Pack 'N Play she was able to provide for our daughter's use, the washer/dryer, the full kitchen, and the cleanliness! The location was ideal, as well. Megan was attentive to our needs, and went above and beyond to ensure our stay was great."

Worth every penny :)"

6252,756594,22944412,2014-11-18,5776988,Nuria,"I stayed with my mom for 12 days at Ling and Chris' listing and we LOVED IT! The property is prettier than it looks on the pictures. It is cozy, perfectly clean, silent, has everything you can need or even more. The bedrooms are beautifully furnished. Everything works fine and they provide all kind of goodies; you can barely bring your tooth brush and you are fine. 
Your day starts with either fresh yoghurt with granola and fruit beautifully presented on a lovely tray, or the daily-made-from-scratch amazing Ling's scones served with different kind of homemade jelly...yummy!
The spa is awesome and it's a great bonus after a long day walking Denver.
The house is only steps from Colfax avenue that takes you right to downtown; the bus stops are just in the corner, very convenient, and the bus system is great! My mom and I came back home late every night and we always felt safe. There are all kinds of stores and restaurants nearby.
Before finalizing the reservation, Ling always got back to me nicely and right away to all of my questions (and I had a few ; ).
Ling and Chris were very helpful with any needs we had, and they were also very respectful to our privacy.
I DEFINITELY recommend this place!!"
77085,12365447,137834972,2017-03-17,63722966,Brittyn,Patrick's home was wonderful. It is obvious how much time and attention he's put into the farmhouse to make it as comfortable for guests as possible. If you're new to Denver this is a great house to stay in - Patrick and his partner are a wealth of knowledge about the city. Thanks again!

56735,8800911,138025620,2017-03-18,13821374,Jason,"This was a really fun location for our group!  Its a pretty short car ride downtown and there are some nice restaurants, coffee shops, Trader Joe's, and a path along a river very close.  Good location.  

The house/church is very nice on the inside with new and modern everything.  It is a very open floor plan.  The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of bathrooms to go around.  The only slight downside is the acoustics.  Noise travels a lot and the two back bedrooms have open ceilings to the rest of the house.  This is only an issue is people are hanging out while others are trying to sleep.  This didn't affect us much, but it may be a consideration for a mixed group (night-owls vs. early risers).

Danny and Christy were super responsive and helped iron out any issues we had. 

Overall we had a nice trip and this was a great spot for us."

Do be aware that it is a basement so you can hear everything upstairs and the water running through the pipes can get pretty loud. It didn’t bother us but if you are a light sleeper take note! 

Overall I would definitely stay again if back in Denver for a short trip."

51895,8352843,53607812,2015-11-10,44454808,Bart,"The title includes bright and remodeled, and they are correct.  We stayed from Thursday to Monday in Brandon and Robert's newly renovated apartment. What a great place.  Brandon was quick to supply information that we needed to find the apartment and how to get in the door.  

I liked that they had a code system on the door so we didn't have to keep up with keys.  Everything was new and was very tastefully done.  They obviously spent not just money but a lot of time getting their place right.  The appliances were new and modern, as were the light fixtures throughout. The heated floors in the bathroom made it so nice when I would walk in there early in the morning.  What a great thing to include.    It was all just so well-done.  

They put a lot of time and effort into making a Welcome Guide booklet that was waiting for us when we arrived.  It explained everything that we needed to know and also included a listing of restaurants, bars and other cool things within walking distance in the neighborhood.   I found in the booklet that Denver Biscuit Company was only 2 blocks away.  Yum! We also found The Spot was a short walk up the cross street when we needed to find a place to watch a football game.  Perfect!

I'm not sure how to better describe our time there and how we felt about the place and Brandon and Robert as hosts.  I guess there's no emoticon that shows me doing a cartwheel.  Everything was great.  I will gladly stay there again when my journeys take me back to Denver. "

The views from the rooftop were perfect for working on my laptop in the afternoons. I was mesmerized by the nighttime view from the hot tub of the city lights. Truly a perfect place to escape from the rigors of business during the day. I really appreciated all of the recommendations for the places near by, I used them every night."
18639,2957097,20811044,2014-10-06,15064190,Tyler,"Jeffery's place is great!  We stayed at his house for a very rare family weekend vacation.  I expressed how privacy was important, and we had the house to ourselves the entire trip.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet Jeffrey, but he left us his number with a bottle of wine which was greatly appreciated.  The location was great, even during rush hour it only took us 10-15 minutes to go downtown.  The house was clean and the beds were comfortable. It's worth noting when we stayed there was only one bathroom upstairs.  There could be another in the basement area, but we didn't go down there. We would happily stay here the next time we come back to Denver!"

243880,38642049,541721760,2019-10-05,89438851,Kellee,"Our stay at Klarissa’s place was really great. We were visiting from Canada to go to a show at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, and we wanted somewhere that was affordable and close to DT area. It was a short ~10 min Uber ride to downtown, and about 20 minutes to Red Rocks which was perfect. The price was really great as well, the house had a fully stocked kitchen and full bathroom. Michael and Klarissa were fast to respond with any questions we had and helped us navigate how to get to their place from the airport by train. I would recommend this place for anyone visiting Denver! Thanks guys."

60704,9250245,242362431,2018-03-11,107287933,Emma,"Loved the overall vibe of The Lobby (the restaurant/bar downstairs — delicious brunch & bottomless mimosas) and the courtyard! It’s a lovely little building with exposed brick and tons of character, and the location is perfect for getting around downtown. 

As mentioned in past reviews, there is a group of homeless people a block or two down the street on the opposite side, but they just kept to themselves. I never once felt unsafe. There is a gated courtyard, a locked door to get into the lofts and then another to get in this particular loft. 

Check in was super easy, and Rob was very responsive! It was tidy and the perfect size for two — maybe three. I would definitely stay here again!"
184690,24159249,444963098,2019-04-28,14254252,Katie,"Loved staying at this stylish spot. It was the perfect location for us, close to downtown for a cousin's wedding. This place has a great kitchen that we wish we had a reason to utilize more! It's the perfect home base."
56418,8741171,457264761,2019-05-23,45378354,Kerie,"This was the perfect Airbnb retreat for my conference in the Denver Tech Center area. Pam's home is beautiful and she is an amazing host (loved the lavender latte!) If the weather had cooperated more, I would have taken advantage of the close walking distance to the conference site. Very convenient and safe neighborhood.  Enjoyed the huge private suite and comfy bed.  Definitely a 5-star experience!"
227467,32092954,445583754,2019-04-29,73981819,Catherine,This house is so clean and nice and conveniently located. There were so many thoughtful details. The neighborhood is quiet and cute and there is a ton of room in the house. Highly recommend.
26374,4191778,475100553,2019-06-23,128785864,Kelly,"This place is in a great location. It is within walking distance from the Moss wedding venue. Parking is street only, but was never a problem. Private entrance with keypad made things easy and convenient to come and go. We met Erin's Dad and he was very nice. It is spacious - will sleep 3 adults comfortably. Lack of cleanliness is our only criticism, but we believe our experience was the exception and not the rule."

107383,15745694,324136681,2018-09-16,207008285,Jimmy,"Angela's home is better than advertised and just perfect for two couples. The home was spacious and very clean with modern appliances. Angela was great with communication from the first inquiry thru check out. We had a mid-day arrival and was allowed a early check-in. While in Denver there was record high temperatures, but low humidity and a breeze made it all ok. Angela's home is very convenient to many different restaurants and cafe's. The neighborhood is quiet and easy to get around to many different places in town.  Please consider this home for your Denver vacation.  Our/My personal favorites are:
Best Breakfast: Lucille's Café.
Best Lunch: Illegal Pete's
Best Dinner: Humboldt Farm Fish Wine / Steuben's.
Best Ice Cream: Sweet Action.
So much to see and do in Denver, never enough time.
Great Day trips to Pikes Peak, Manitou Springs, Golden, and Breckinridge.
 Thanks for opening your home. Melissa, Mark, Cindy & Jimmy."

29729,4573687,24956838,2015-01-04,10113904,Anthony,Loren helped provide everything we needed to have a good time in Denver.  As a host he was available via the airbnb application for anything we needed and kind enough to leave us beers to get the good times rolling quicker. 
150376,20914531,230961641,2018-01-29,55692938,Brandon,"This is a great little place, and I enjoyed staying at this home while visiting Denver. The home was very clean, tastefully decorated, and the owners sent a very detailed overview prior to check-in. I especially appreciated all the local tourism pamphlets, which helped me add a few fun stops to my itinerary. Thanks for sharing your home with me!"

97665,14672294,350854060,2018-11-20,89256298,KyungMin,"first thing you should know: it is located in the basement. so cold everytime and humid, and the window without curtain violates your privacy.
There is only one bed, it means other people should sleep on many couches. 
the host answers fast, but does not take a measure. For example, there was a light out of order. we asked him to fix it but he didn't do anything."
190228,24846197,351400543,2018-11-22,52254190,Marcus,Great place that is super easy to access as well close to great dining and entertainment. The unit was clean and was very comfortable. The 10 am check out time was kinda brutal but overall it was a great time

81861,12991472,472416313,2019-06-19,33743693,Nathan,"Great place to land if visiting the Denver. I had business that took me to downtown Denver for a few days and Douglas’s place was perfect!

If like me you are tired of staying at the same hotels and want something that makes you feel more like a resident (and something more homey) look to Douglas’s place.

Location is near many local restaurants/brewery’s, easy carshare to downtown, I even walked given it was a nice day out.

The space has all you need, and is spacious for an individual or couple. 

Cleanliness and communication were great:) I also appreciated what Douglas had as nice touches (ie. charging cables). It also was nice to see how easy checkout was!

If traveling to downtown, I would stay here again."
48989,7843605,451405466,2019-05-11,162277566,Cassie,"This a great location and Cynthia is a good and reliable communicator. The unit is a basement unit, very dark, and has exposed pipes which can be quite loud at all different times of the night. There is not a separate door to the bedroom, just a curtain and the additional sleeping is on fold out mattress pads, not a true bed. Everything you need is provided including parking off the street, but you do basically have to drive up on the curb to park. This served our purposes for one night, with 3 adults."

138852,19489806,496540642,2019-07-27,1515380,Elias,"Paul was a great, friendly host. On my first day, he offered to show me around Denver to get the lay of the land. Thanks Paul! His place is spacious, clean, by a nice park in a residential neighborhood. He keeps a tidy ship and has placed post it notes as reminders for some of the rules (instructions above alarm box for entry and exit), which I found helpful.  He had breakfast foods available which made things convenient as well as the ability to do laundry. Nice bonus!  There is a great coffee shop a block away where I worked out of during the day. It was a very comfortable stay and a definite recommend if you prefer to be in more quiet and residential part of the city."
33441,5334219,34320852,2015-06-07,803589,Robyn,"This space was such a dream for us. Completely spotless, stylishly furnished, and stocked with all the basics and more. She provided a helpful folder with all the info we needed for our stay, and a list of great restaurants in the area. Extra points for the cushy bathrobes in each of the bedrooms! :)

The neighborhood is absolutely fantastic. There are many adorable restaurants and shops only a 30 second walk from the back door, and the edge of downtown is only a 10 minute walk.

We met Susan at the end of our stay, and she was such a bright and friendly woman. She allowed us to enjoy our entire 3 night stay undisturbed, but was only a call away and ready to help if needed.

Looking forward to coming back to Denver, and will definitely stay here when I do! "

We will definitely stay here again on our next trips to Denver!"

The room is in the basement with an awesome hangout space shared with the other rooms. Their home and cozy and comfortable. Liz let me do some laundry (even though I was only there for 1 night- thank you!) and Liz and Jason were available for all of our questions! 

Spectacular hosts, definitely would stay again :)"

Bed is comfortable. The bathroom is huge, also very clean with an awesome jetted tub, candles included. So relaxing after a long day of traveling. Scott is super nice. Was able to meet him and he showed me around the house and all amenities. Only suggestion would be for darker shades. Sun really lights up the room at sunrise. This place I would agree is like an Upscale Hostel, met some very nice folks while staying here. Would definitely stay here again."

25857,4121807,56711126,2015-12-16,42797788,Jay,Colby and his wife made my first Airbnb experience a great one. The house and their hospitality was pleasant and accommodating. Colby was very flexible with me and my GF with our checkout time and when  we needed an emergency additional night stay due to a winter storm. I cannot praise them enough.

The Airbnb is located in a very convenient spot-it is close to downtown and most of the restaurants we wanted to go to. I would definitely book Gary's place again next time I return to Denver! 
132009,18634186,172693272,2017-07-21,83330526,Maggie,"The basement apartment was as described. Clean, comfortable, and a nice new bathroom. As it is in a basement there is no AC or much natural light. It was convenient to taxi/uber to downtown Denver in 15-20 minutes and in quiet neighborhood. Good for a business visit to the city where you need a clean place to stay. Basement was accessible through stairs from the side of the house and two other doors from inside the house that remained locked from the inside so it felt secure."

The little touches of sleepy time sinus tea, humidifiers, and great beds really helped us have a stress free work trip. And we did not have to go far for amazing breakfast and dinner. The home is located in a great spot where we could walk almost to all places."

The house is very clean and spacious, and the Sonos speakers in every room was a great touch!  Your bedroom door has its own key pad for privacy and safety, and the bathrooms were crystal clean.  

I will definitely look to stay here in the future and recommend anyone visiting to book this spot!

Hope to visit again soon,

Mr. and Mrs. Sasaki were most welcoming and friendly.  Everything was extremely clean and well kept.  They had snacks, fruit and tea available for us.  They were most helpful on how to best use our limited time in Denver and suggested that we use the light rail train to get to the Avalanche game, saving us the headache of driving downtown and hunting for expensive event parking.  We will most definitely stay again when in the Denver area. "

110459,15957321,133114052,2017-02-20,92729668,Olga,"My friends and I stayed at Sarah's place for a girls' weekend and had a fabulous time! The seven of us were able to fit into and use the space quite comfortably. One girl was not able to make the trip at the very last minute, but I'm sure the place would have been just fine for a total of eight people as well. Those of us who made it adored the Airbnb's decor and found the whole place to be a great home away from home for a couple of days. I found the listing to be totally accurate. Although my friends and I often drove around to certain destinations we wanted to visit, we noticed there were a lot of options for food and drink closer to the Airbnb as well. I told Sarah that I don't think any of us would hesitate to stay again if ever given the chance. Thank you again, Sarah!"

The owners have a great book of recommendations for activities in Denver as well. The size is perfect for a couple. Exactly as depicted in the pictures. "
48988,7843605,450221249,2019-05-08,95663535,Agatha,"Great, stylish basement apartment. Sofa and bed very comfortable. All the amenities you would need for a great stay. 
Only cons were the European laundry which was not the easiest to manoeuvre and use, but once figured out it did the job. 
The plumbing is also awful - Cynthia does leave a note to advise only toilet paper in toilet, however the toilet often needed 3-4 flushes of the toilet which was quiet unpleasant. 
Lastly, it’s a basement apartment so obviously there is lots of noise through the thin walls and ceilings. We could hear the thumping of feet and conversations until 3am. Cynthia says that you can message her and she’ll tell them to be quiet - but I was not going to do that at 2am."

The LoHi neighborhood is a trendy area with many choices of restaurants and cute shops around. The location of this townhome was perfect, we were able to walk to our dinners at El Five, Linger and Root Down! 

The Townhome was perfect for us girls, spacious and great living room/kitchen for us all to sit around and catch up on life! The roof top deck was a favorite too! Great views of downtown Denver and comfy outdoor patio furniture!

Jordan was a pleasure as well, she was attentive to any questions I had even when she was out of town for a wedding! Would recommend her place time and time again! "

The interior is in great shape, featuring lots of period detail and an updated bathroom.  I stayed on the top floor, which features great views over the park and the city, as well as floor-to-ceiling wood paneling.  Both spacious and cozy!  The only drawback is the very steep steps leading to the top-floor room:  not for those with uncertain balance or heavy luggage!  Vincent was very responsive to messages and made the experience of staying at his house easy and enjoyable."

It was surprising to walk into, but good surprising. The back yard was fun. I wouldn't stay here with young children, simply because of some of the imagery of the decorations, but for my group of travelers it worked great."

Not only was she super responsive and friendly, but her space was clean and cute and felt like home with her personal touches. Check in was easy and convenient with keyless entry.

Prior to arriving I did not receive and check-in instructions, I had to message Leif to ask how to get . A few days after saying there Leif messaged us saying we had to pay cash for a Denver tax(22$), I paid through Airbnb app, I think that the tax should be disclosed in the listing of the rented space prior to booking, and should be paid via Airbnb not in cash. We had accessibility to washer and dryer. The bed seemed to sink in a bit in the middle, but wasn’t horrible . The space was private which was why we booked it."

very centrally located and is within a short driving distance of many other great Denver interests.  FYI, we loved everything on the menu at the Jamaican restaurant just down the street."

Alicia was very welcoming and included sweet touches in the space. I really appreciated that we weren't expected to clean the whole place before leaving. With small children, it was a gift to not worry about all the details of our stay. Thank you for an amazing stay!"

Thanks for a great stay!"

The location could not have been better for our adventures of going downtown, heading out to a show at Red Rocks, or hopping over to Boulder for a quick stop. We did not meet Juan, but the check-in/check-out process went very smoothly. Would highly recommend!"
39164,6348993,158461147,2017-06-06,17690479,Su-Yin,"Matt and Vicki were so sweet and easy to communicate with. They greeted us upon arrival and showed us around the space, which was exactly as described. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom clean, and the included drink at the nearby coffee shop was an extra special touch. Unfortunately our stay was short so we didn't get to take advantage of their outdoor porch area but we loved the place and would definitely come back if we're in the Denver area again!"

127702,18152418,281809757,2018-06-25,34484391,Susan,"Gorgeous, stylish home in an awesome neighborhood near RiNo. I live in a suburb of the metro Denver area and chose The Fortress as a base for city activities while family was visiting. It worked out perfectly -- walking to cafes and admiring all the Victorian homes and pretty gardens, Uber-ing for cheap to locales we didn't feel like walking to. Urban but quiet, this would be a great stay-cation spot! Thanks Jolene + Rachel! "
41030,6574455,183955058,2017-08-18,55463548,Susan,"Kelly is a wonderful host. Five stars all around! She is so kind and helpful and went out of her way to make the accommodations perfect for me.

132303,18736259,199727666,2017-10-02,2752915,Katie,"Jamie's place was the perfect place for my boyfriend and I to stay in Denver to attend the Broncos game and explore the city for a long weekend. The public transportation (Central Park Station) was close. We thought we would use this however we ended up using Uber most of the weekend. There was always an Uber driver close by in the neighborhood to pick us up. This location is close to a walking/biking/running trail and some yummy food. The basement is charming and quiet. It felt like I was staying at a hotel suite for a fraction of the cost!  Jamie's dog, Sadie, was curious but calm and well mannered. Jamie was easy to contact and flexible with arrangements. I would recommend her place to any one staying in Denver!"
55691,8718728,327296368,2018-09-23,88184911,Amy,Rachel is very friendly and helpful. The location of her place is pretty close to downtown so it’s pretty convenient . Enjoyed the stay.

Great visit to Denver!

167872,22303051,275702286,2018-06-11,104790363,Drew,This is a great place to stay in Denver. Outside the main downtown but able to access quickly.

The house is incredible, and the location is great. It's a great place to get work done or explore the city. On site parking was always available and easy to access. Highly recommended!"
75147,12068403,100470675,2016-09-09,73844337,Olivia,"We travelled to Denver with baseball in mind. This location was idea for walking to Coors Field and neighboring areas. The property was beautiful and it exceeded our expectations, but be aware the property is in somewhat of a shady area with shady people hanging about. The loft was cute, clean, spacious, and easy to get to. My husband is a police officer and he noticed a lot of sketchy activity; more than the average person would notice, but the location was so desirable in relation to Coors Field. I would stay here again, but I wouldn't bring my children. Lots of homelessness and shadiness in surrounding area. However, this property is within walking distance to a lot of cool places. Definitely try Snooze AM for breakfast. :) "

74199,11722154,240681300,2018-03-05,75219165,Margalit,"AJ and Kats’ place was really nice. We had our own private entrance to the basement and were provided a full kitchen and cable tv. It only costed around $8-$15 to uber most places in Denver. AJ and Kat responded instantly to any and all questions and concerns. I wish I could have gotten to meet them in person (as well as their dogs haha). Only thing I would mention is that anytime my sister and I both needed to shower, the water turned cold after about 12 minutes. We also only had one mirror to share in getting ready. If you’re two or more people just make sure to not shower right after one another."

89406,13724407,99864521,2016-09-06,81957606,Amanda,"Marco was a great host. He communicated with us from the start, so there were no surprises. He accommodated our needs with ease and was very attentive to anything that may have popped up. His listing was beautiful and clean. And in a really neat neighnorhood. The house was the perfect size for 6 adults and a baby! I thought it was a cosy home with a large yard. 
I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone in the Denver area!"
216666,29466288,513617766,2019-08-19,100240947,Cierra,This is a good option if you need a place to stay and your on a budget. I got to meet a variety of interesting people and managed to get a bed in a quiet room downstairs. Bring your own shower supplies because towels are sparse and shower soaps are not provided.
153373,21037776,542625320,2019-10-06,200440533,Ashley-Renee,"Everything, and I mean everything about Brian’s home was spot on and incredible. From the details in the amenities to the stylish setting and decor of the home itself. Brian has provided such an incredible and comforting environment that I truly didn’t think could come from staying in someone else’s home. This cute little abode is located in such a great area with 15 minute ride to downtown. Going to Denver I will always stay here. Thank you so so so much for everything and being an incredible host. Until next time"

I don’t know if the inventors of Airbnb had any idea that this service would enable transformative, rich, comfortable accommodation experiences that even the finest hotels can only dream of. 
Kat is gracious host. Her home is the best place. Congratulations in advance to you, travelers, for finding it."

It was great for us as a party of four.

No on site parking and a dilemma in maneuverability in entranceway "

26439,4219371,479188090,2019-06-30,193760806,Sunny,Dawn and Jacob were incredible hosts! The house was recently remodeled to which it had the best amenities along with being very comfortable and clean.

It was a very relaxing and charming apartment to come back to after long days at a conference. I would definitely recommend this place to others if they are going to Denver!"
137143,19293155,250963283,2018-04-06,92932961,Brian,"The place was very comfortable. For our purposes, it was located in a great area Bc it was quick and easy to access highway. We were in Denver to visit friends in the surrounding area. However, if your intention is to stay in the city, this place will be great. There are a lot of restaurants and other things to do within walking distance."
28632,4294257,279103737,2018-06-19,80597832,Scott,"This place is in a great location, very comfortable and had everything we could ever need and then some. Bikes were great and cam in handy. Travis was the greatest! Would definitely recommend and will probably return.

Thanks!!"

3183,236207,19932149,2014-09-21,15358829,Cherie,"Dave was a very welcoming host, all the way through from enquiring about the unit to past the end of our stay - he went above and beyond and we really appreciated his hospitality. His travel tips turned out to be great and enhanced our trip around Colorado.
Everything at the Penthouse was as advertised and was clean, comfortable, convenient, competitively priced and well equipped. Although we found the views from the apartment interesting, they weren't ""awesome"" until the last night when we were treated to a fabulous fireworks display from the stadium - that was pretty awesome!
The only negative comment we have about the Penthouse (and probably easily enough fixed) was the very noisy washing machine - we were worried the machine was going to jump out of the cupboard. "
94083,14043521,146795517,2017-04-23,20895058,Craig,The house has been updated and modernized in a most appealing way that was charming and organized. One of the cleanest ABNB I have ever stayed at. Do take the time to download the Sonos app and enjoy the whole house sound. I am a chef and the kitchen exceeded expectations. 
29652,4545539,348156336,2018-11-12,68306307,James,"One of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve had- Tyler’s place exceeded expectations and was a chic, home away from home for us. And can we talk about bathroom/closet space!? Can’t wait to stay here again when visiting friends in the city."
140606,19671778,350876261,2018-11-20,140047375,Michele,"Small Refrigerator was a good plus .
Water in the refrigerator was great plus. The bed was amazing ! I don’t sleep well and was susceptible to wake up in the wrong time zone so the bed definitely helped me !! Super comfy. Clean and neat . Great accessibility to the unit ! When walking in hall motion lighting so people who don’t know where the light switches are can see ;)"
101243,15054823,138797637,2017-03-21,106957737,Ashley,Really cool place! The neighborhood is quiet and nice and it's a easy 10 min Uber from downtown.
146755,20475481,321184223,2018-09-09,213623518,Katrina,"The check in was terrible, with no one there and no clear instructions on how to get in, when I called to ask about our check in, which we had booked on Wednesday, we were told that our host was out of town and that the space may not be ready, I expressed mild frustration that the space wasn’t ready and was meted with a sharp and rude answer that we should just cancel then. After explaining that we didn’t want to cancel just get in the house because we were hot and tired and in from out of town, the host told us how to get in. Once we were in we noticed a terrible smell and dirt all over the stair floors, as we went upstairs we saw trash and dirt all over, including a dead bird in a birdcage, after that and seeing dog poop on the patio. We immediately called Airbnb support, afraid to call Hugh the host after his outburst and rudeness in the earlier conversation. Airbnb support tried to reach out to Hugh multiple times but he didn’t respond so Airbnb helped find new accommodations for the night. It was an awful experience, luckily Airbnb support was super helpful!"
147999,20652963,460211696,2019-05-28,58002687,Ryan,Great place. Easy check in and great communication. The place is very clean and spacious. Really enjoyed our stay.

167213,22201970,492860679,2019-07-21,57568289,Dustin,Great spot! Close to everything! Would stay again.
190568,24906976,512867188,2019-08-18,3064872,Lisbeth,Loved staying at Caren’s! Not only is her place close to everything but the space is filled with thoughtful details for a greatly curated book selection (helped myself to one for a day at Big Soda Lake) to a fully stocked bathroom with all kinds of toiletries. The separate access to the apartment gives you complete freedom to come as you go. While only 420 friendly outside she has a beautiful deck to enjoy. Would recommend to anyone looking for a cozy place to stay after exploring all day.
73901,11692342,279783318,2018-06-21,62835420,Maria,"Nina’s was a great place to stay! Good location, many restaurants nearby. It was very clean, quiet and cozy. We had a large truck that was a little difficult to park in the lot for her place but she was very accommodating and helpful when we arrived! I would definitely stay again! "
180375,23669031,340093677,2018-10-22,209359523,Gulden,"My research group stayed at this house to work for 3 nights. It was a perfect house for us to get some work done. There were many great restaurants, grocery and a park walking distance and it was very close to the airport. We had 5 guests flying from different locations and met at this house to get some great work done. Since the restaurants and grocery were at a walking distance, we did not waste any time for food. The living room spaces provided us great places to get in small and big groups to have our discussions done. The neighborhood was very quiet as well. The house was very clean and had all our needed items (kitchen for basic cooking, tv for projecting work for group discussions, spacious bedrooms, etc.). The internet connection was spotty time to time but we think it was due to having several computers and phones trying to connect. Jordan was great to provide answers quickly. Recommend this house highly!"
206572,27696005,408100797,2019-02-03,49049979,Matt,"Our stay was excellent! Jim was a great host and left us with the desire to come back. His house is close to dining and the supermarket. The basement was awesome, and included a pool table and darts. Good WiFi and TV, beds were comfortable, and the pictures of Jim’s adventures were a nice touch. Great location, close to hikes, breweries, and close proximity to red rocks and downtown. 

Definitely check out the Great Harvest Bread Co. I would come back just for their breakfast pockets."
123523,17387231,445669548,2019-04-29,253623365,Chris,Not exactly what we expected based on the pictures on the listing. Taylor is painting his entire house and it would’ve been nice to have given a heads up. Good location and comfy bed.
210272,28347054,552891183,2019-10-22,28344946,Elise,"Selina was quick to respond and gave clear check in and out instructions. The apartment was very clean and well organized. While the apartment was a little further out of the city than I expected, there was easy access to the highway and plenty of street parking. Would recommend for your Denver trip."
38044,6141491,275778704,2018-06-11,91207613,Lorri,Great location!  Plenty of room for a large group. Brian wants to make sure you have a great stay.  Brian is very responsive should you have questions or if issues arise.  Great host!

209612,28137750,400029541,2019-01-10,88283220,Dawn,Very clean and well managed. That trundle bed was super comfortable. No privacy door to room but had screens up. Woken at 6am by a screaming toddler after arriving late from airport. I believe they are running a day care. The room I stayed in would be great for a single person with small children but not traveling singles. Value was there. Next time I will ask if there are kids at the house. Lesson learned

12787,1733052,277169763,2018-06-15,37616907,Dee,We had a very pleasant stay and the accommodations were very comfortable. Locating the address and the parking situation was a little challenging upon arrival and departure. We seemed to time it just right and blocked other cars from entering the garage or the alley each time. Jason and his wife were very gracious and helpful in providing us suggestions regarding dining out and gave us an excellent referral!

Location is a short Uber or drive from LoDo and other great towns in Denver. Travis additionally provided us with amazing suggestions for activities and dining as well!

Pros: 
Keypad entry makes it easy to come and go.
Quiet neighborhood and quiet house.
Ample parking.
Easy to interact with owners.
Bed is soooooo comfortable.
 
Cons:
Staircase leading to room can be treacherous for taller people.
Washer/Dryer directly outside room. Can bother some people but we didn't mind much."

226630,31905174,522263344,2019-09-01,66969939,Taylor,"We loved our stay at Leslie's! The space was clean and adorable. Lots of nice touches, natural light and the beds were comfy. Also the shower was awesome! Leslie communicated quickly and was very accommodating when we requested an earlier check in due to arrival! We would love to spend more time in Denver and stay here again!"

73340,11521979,293174244,2018-07-19,42084014,Grace,"We loved our stay at Jenna’s house! This place is in an awesome location in the RiNo district and so close to coffee shops, breweries, restaurants and shops! We did hear some noises upstairs like footsteps and mumbled voices/everyday noise, so if you need a perfectly peaceful place, this might not suit you. The only thing we didn’t love was parking, sometimes it was hard to find street parking and we’d have to park a few blocks away, but that’s understandable in such an up and coming neighborhood. The room was clean, bed was comfy, and it was everything we needed for a quick stay! Thanks Jenna!"
177063,23312555,266860575,2018-05-20,27505787,Abhay,"This place is incredible.  It's big, clean, has everything you need, and the managers/owners are hospitable.  12 of us stayed here for my bachelor party, and we had a blast.  Alex even had beer waiting for us when we got there.  I would recommend this to any big group looking to have a great weekend in Denver."

My wife and I loved it!"

34138,5402378,105962914,2016-10-03,85565621,Elise,"My husband and I live in the neighborhood and rented this place for a staycation, so we are already familiar with the area. The house is beautifully updated and the backyard is HUGE! We enjoyed having a comfortable place away from home and loved the hot tub (our primary reason for selecting this listing). It was also nice to have the Apple TV with Netflix on it. It would be awesome to spend the weekend here, and we are likely to book again sometime in the future!"
96245,14423349,249767201,2018-04-02,23423737,Joana,"Ruth's place is exactly as advertised. It's the basement of her home, but so comfortable. I slept like a baby. The location was awesome. The neighborhood is very quiet but has some local bars and restaurants walking distance. Yes, we did hear her dog but he only barked when we arrived. If you are a light sleeper though, I wouldn't recommend it as you can hear movement from upstairs. It was no big deal for us and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."

180582,23685442,304064211,2018-08-08,177132298,Kevin,"Diana is an amazing host! My flight at the airport was cancelled around 9:30pm and all hotels were booked. I thought it would be a long shot to get this spot, but Diana responded immediately - and didn't stop! All she requested from me was 30 minutes so that she could clean her home, and sparkly clean it was.

My phone battery was low and my charger wasn't working, because that's just how that day was going. When I finally got a working charger, I opened my phone to a text from Diana wondering if I was okay, and even offered to pick me up because she was concerned I couldn't find the place. I mean, talk about a story that writes itself.

When I finally arrived, the entry process was simple enough. Before I knew it, I was inside this incredible shack where even snacks and drinks were awaiting.

The space was super cozy. I ended my long night watching Family Guy before heading off to bed, where I enjoyed the most wonderful four hours of sleep in my life. In the morning, I took a refreshing shower and was sad that I couldn't stay longer.

If you're ever in the area and need a place to crash, I can't recommend this space enough. Every bit of it was perfect, and so was Diana."
133283,18811589,337860161,2018-10-17,164681880,Kenneth,This was an absolute gem. From the moment we arrived curbside it was a great stay 10/10 would recommend

58705,9080234,55146977,2015-11-28,1351491,Elizabeth,"Staying at Tyler and Katie's house was a wonderful experience! The place felt instantly like home. Everything was clean and orderly, the beds were comfortable, and it has an updated kitchen and baths. We stayed over Thanksgiving and the kitchen was super well stocked with pots and pans, and they were gracious enough to allow us to use spices, condiments, and other small kitchen niceties. They were very organized and gave us a (Hidden by Airbnb) doc with all instructions and check in/check out procedures. They were very responsive and gracious and I would definitely stay with them again!"
144634,20248046,202754612,2017-10-12,11244731,Catalina,"Josh and Lucia are amazing hosts. The space is very clean, modern, and full of thoughtful touches. The location is just a short uber ride from downtown, the arts district, and hiking trails. We found it easy to navigate even without a car. Couldn't have asked for a more perfect space to spend a few nights in Denver! Thank you!"

157600,21297522,567496882,2019-11-22,52011405,Johnny,Nice place close to downtown! Jose was an excellent host and incredibly helpful. Would highly recommend this place if you’re looking to stay in Downtown Denver but want to save a little!
120632,17122136,505658677,2019-08-09,216176724,Ruben,"The neighborhood felt a little sketchy, which is something I’m used to, but if you’re paranoid about safety, it might not be the place for you. Other than that, I thought the place was great. The room was clean and allergy free (for me) and the tenants, who occupy the basement, were quiet and unobtrusive. The only downside that might occur is that if you wanted to sleep in, the shower might wake you. It’s located right next to the room and is loud. All in all though, this was a good stay."
145945,20358695,561139715,2019-11-08,231703274,Jacob,Great place to stay. Very clean. Very accommodating. Recommend to anyone that has a group that's staying or even just a family.
130534,18449124,456893123,2019-05-22,9313699,Jim And Belinda,This was a fantastic place to stay in Denver. Quiet neighborhood and easy Uber to all the great breweries and restaurants in Denver and RiNo area. I would love to stay here anytime. Kristen is a great host and communicates easily for check-in.

42237,6883917,240382639,2018-03-04,35910579,Heather,Everything was exactly as Ryan and Gloria said! Plus they even left me a mint on my towels which was a special touch. Everything was clean and organized in my room. Having my own bathroom was wonderful as well. They were easy to communicate with and gave detailed directions that made sense. Ryan also gave me information about snowboarding that saved me money and gave me a better experience hitting the slopes out West for the first time. Grateful for people like Ryan and Gloria who make traveling on a budget possible. Totally recommend their place!
48106,7790834,191766216,2017-09-08,52398452,John,This was a great location in a very cute neighborhood. Very close to the highway for when you need to get to the mountains. Very comfortable bed. I slept so well. Oh and the dog is very nice and friendly.

Heather solved an air vent problem very kindly and efficiently although we didn't happen to meet. We would recommend breakfast and diner in Vine Street, very close by. We were able to park close by which was great. Thanks Heather !"

179661,23626064,345307474,2018-11-04,213362879,Jeff,"This place was great!  It's spacious, clean, and in a really fun location.   We were able to walk to tons of great restaurants and breweries, which is exactly what we were looking for.  The roof deck has an amazing view of downtown Denver.  There's also a really nice gym located in the building that we took advantage of (not included).  Check-in/out was very easy and the hosts are extremely responsive.  Street parking was never an issue.  We'd definitely consider staying here again in the future.

Couple of notes for future guests...not negatives, just observations.  RiNo is not the most family oriented neighborhood.  Coming from Chicago, we knew what we were getting into and picked the location due to what it has to offer.  Breweries & restaurants were all very accommodating, but I don't think we saw another stroller all weekend.  The condo has several sliding barn doors which look really cool, but something to consider based on who you are traveling with as privacy levels might not be what you're used to at home."
2287,98008,2197653,2012-09-04,3259159,Terese,"Jim's house is the most beautiful house ever! Every little detail is thought through and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay at. The neighbourhood is superb, safe and just a short walk to downtown. Restaurants and grocery store around the corner.
Jim made us feel at home and he gave us great suggestions of things to do in Denver. His whole family is really warm and considerate. We're so glad we got to meet these amazing people and that we stayed in this amazing house!"

The check in process was great - flexible to fit our schedules. Directions, being ""directionally challenged"", were spot on. It's a short drive or uber ride from downtown. Had all the essentials: great shower, kitchen, comfy bed, patio, wifi and Netflix - not sure what else you could possibly need.  

Will definitely be staying here for any future trips to Denver!"

Cortinas nos quartos, pintura nas paredes. Já fiquei em outros porões nos US e estavam melhor arrumados pelo mesmo preço."

The location is spectacular - super close to Downtown Denver, a short ride to Boulder, and driving distance to national parks, etc.  The house was very safe and clean. The amenities were also wonderful as there is a kitchenette, nice size bathroom, and laundry in the house. Susan communicated with us every step of the way and made our stay very enjoyable. Overall, it was a great value and I would definitely recommend Susan's carriage house to anyone visiting the Denver area! I would also stay here again. "

Comfy bed, extra pillows, blankets, toiletries, paper towels, I could go on. It was an effortless experience.  It was  like being at a high end resort without the staff."

I was able to walk all over the city using this as my home base. As they note in the listing, you do have to step outside to use the bathroom, but it’s a short distance (really just a few steps) and it didn’t bother me any! Overall had a great stay!"
112071,16089404,522992249,2019-09-02,235299054,Robert,Jim was a fantastic host. We had 9 of us stay at the place over Labor Day weekend. The house is in a great location and walking to distance to many great restaurants and bars. We hope we get a chance to come back out and use the place again.

While there, we were invited to their daughter's birthday party (couldn't make it) but they shared some of their food anyway. The injera was delicious as well as the spicy, savory meat and sauce.  The night before check out, a snow storm hit the area, and caused us to slide a lot on the freeway.  They allowed us to stay a little longer the next day so we could call tire stores and figure out our new travel plan. They were very accommodating to our needs and Yohanne was very quick in responding to our messages"

74566,11789571,468542232,2019-06-12,91634674,Dan,"Staying at this house was excellent. It has a nice spot within walking distance to grab a nice bite to eat for any meal, a good coffee shop just down the street and is a short drive to downtown. We stayed with 4 people and felt like there was plenty of room during our stay. The check-in process was very simple via a lockbox which is always a bonus for me when I stay somewhere. Although our interactions with Kenny and the other hosts were limited, they were very kind and welcoming."

It was a beautiful house with updated features, slept us all very comfortably and was very reasonably priced for its prime location. I will definitely be returning if I need to stay in Denver again. In addition to an amazing property, Claudia and Jeremy were wonderful hosts. They were very quick with communication and everything went very smoothly. Would definitely recommend to anyone coming to the Denver area."

Wonderful walkability if you are interested in the RiNo area, we spent a lot of time on foot exploring breweries, shops and galleries in the area. Downtown not too far of a walk either, with Uber as a good affordable back up option. Don’t miss
All the amazing local art near by! The Curtis Park neighborhood is quiet and safe, and the park across the street a nice place to relax. Unit was as pictured, clean and spacious, good heater. Internet was a bit spotty but only went out once. Although I didnt meet Mark in person, communication was excellent. Would have been nice to have more kindling/ wood for fire pit (it was depleted by the time we got to it) but he did offer to credit us back if we ended up buying any. A very generous offer but unfortunately we were unable to find time to do so. He organized us to meet with partner Valerie who helped store luggage before arrival and after checkout, she even had our unit ready for us early upon request. I will DEFINITELY look to them as first choice upon my return to Denver. Excellent hosts, unit, location... you can’t go wrong! Enjoy!"

She was very accommodating and generous (left us chocolate, tea, coffee and even epsom salt for the bathtub!) and checked in with me to make sure our stay was excellent once a day. I was traveling with my boyfriend and our two dogs and Melissa was proactive about communicating her pet policy, which was very helpful (we were able to keep them in the kitchen and off the furniture while we were out). We were so happy with the location of her home and the friendly neighbors. The patio was perfect for the beautiful weather we had during our stay.

It was my second time in a bnb and my first time staying in a bnb without a travel buddy and and I was nervous, but Jessica made me feel really comfortable and relaxed from the moment I got there and the communication was great the whole time. 
She was super laid back and chill and was happy to chat or offer suggestions on what to do or places to eat.
The room is really clean, quiet and private and Jessica respected my privacy and space.

I got there a little earlier than planned and her check in was flexible and she was really nice about it. : )

I would definitely recommend staying here and would stay again.
Thank you again for the wonderful stay. ♡"

Charming neighborhood and a 10 min walk from Cheesman Park! The only downsides is that is was a little bit warm at night (although there is a fan you can move to the bedroom) and the shower drainage was a little slow. Other than that, would 100% stay here again in the future."

Our family loved the city view of Denver from the park.  We cooked family dinners and the place definitely had everything needed.  Sandra and Kendra are awesome host and super hospitable. The home was so cozy and perfectly decorated.  We use airbandb almost exclusively and this stay was one of our top stays.
217438,29651605,439258852,2019-04-18,191974952,Roberto,10 out of 10 we’d stay here again. Kinga always responded to any questions or concerns I had within minutes. The only negative about this place is the stove heater was blasting and there didn’t seem to be a way to turn it down but we also didn’t ask because it was barely an issue and I can imagine how lovely it would be on a cold Colorado night. The location was fantastic and the patio view of the mountains and city skyline was incredible. This was the best Airbnb experience we’ve had!

Within walking distance to Larimer shops and restaurants. Beautifully decorated, Ashlee was a great host and while I didn't get to meet her, she was communicative and helpful all along the way. Would 200% recommend! "

They felt like every detail was perfect and the hosts had really gone out of their way to make the home welcoming and comfortable. Cleanliness was outstanding and everything in the house worked very well. My kids had a blast in the ""game room"" downstairs and the location near Tennyson St. is convenient for a short walk to restaurants and bars. If I could give 6 stars I would!"

Neighbors were friendly and quiet.    The beds were very comfy (memory foam type mattress).  Marcus was always quick to respond to any questions I had.  The location makes it easy to walk to restaurants, bars, a grocery store and Coors Field.  It was a great stay overall and we hope to stay again in the future!"

Access in and out and upon arrival was easy by a code that locks the door. 

The entire place is brand need from ceiling to floor. Exceptionally clean throughout. Beds including sheets were like being at a 5 star hotel, so comfy. 

Every amenity is there: every appliance new, private and new laundry (including soap and even softener sheets), keurig w tower full of coffee cups (cream and sugar), fridge w various drinks and bottled water, a full snack bowl, air purifiers, toaster, dish washer, and tourist guides. Plenty towels, toiletries, you literally just need to bring clothes. 

Gary seemed to know the balance between privacy and offering his knowledge of the area and being accommodating. We even got to hangout and us a stand up guy. 

Location is close to all Denver has to offer and only 2 miles from downtown. 

Overall the best experience I've ever had on AirBNB by far.

Downtown Denver is a short ride from the house, but there are a lot of shops, restaurants, and dispensaries nearby if you just want to run out to get something and not head into the heart of town. I come to Denver once or twice a year and would definitely stay here again."

The location is close to several restaurants and a bus, and we actually were able to walk from the breweries in the RiNo district within a few minutes. The bathroom is especially lovely! My friend and I only stayed for a couple nights, but would happily stay again or recommend it to other visitors. One food tip: I highly enjoyed getting breakfast from the Rolling Pin bakery down the street."

Aaron was very responsive and the house was great and as advertised in the pictures! There’s a great range of local options for food and drink in the neighborhood but also close enough to other areas of Denver that a short drive can get you to. Thanks Aaron for being a great host and I would definitely recommend staying here!

The apartment was very clean, the bed  was super comfortable, the linens were great, and the kitchen was well equipped with good quality items.  It is obvious that Vince cares about his properties and wants to create a great experience for his guests.  This apartment was on a quieter side of the building so we were not disturbed by the amazing nightlife of downtown.  On thing to note the air conditioner is very loud, so if you have a third person as we did, they may find it a bit loud to sleep with.  No issue in the bedroom.  Overall a wonderful stay."
105223,15471561,247811878,2018-03-29,687589,Nizam,"Great location walking distance to:
1.  Root Down for fresh organic food 
2. The legendary Little Man ice cream
3. Linger (sister restaurant to Root Down)

The entertainment floor was great for movie night with my wife and two young kids. 

Great views from the 2nd and 3rd floor

This is how you should do Denver"

Preston was also super helpful with pointing me to an amazing hike in nearby Boulder, which I certainly would not have found if it weren't for him.

Overall, my trip to Denver just wouldn't have been the same if I hadn't stayed with Preston."

I met Bekele and his wife briefly, they are both very kind and hospitable. The apartment was bigger than I expected, so it was comfortable enough for myself and the friend I shared the space with. Would recommend."

There is a 3/4 bath that is separate with two entry’s, one in the living and one for the bedroom, so the bathroom can be accessed if someone is sleeping.  Jamie’s home is in a quiet residential area.  The neighborhood has newer modern homes and is safe.  There are market and stores close by so there was no problem getting anything you need.  Very easy access to the interstate.  Jamie and her husband are wonderful hosts and we had easy to be around.  We were very busy and hardly saw them. It was a great stay and exactly what we needed and wanted.  Very modern and cozy place.  Thanks Jamie for responding so quickly.  Just wonderful!"

Be sure to read the amenities closely as we came without some basics that weren't provided (shampoo/soap, coffeemaker provided but no coffee, etc.). It may also have been neighbors or another visitor, but the space smelled vaguely of cigarette smoke. Didn't bother us, but may be a consideration if you are sensitive!"

We only stayed 2 nights, but we had all the amenities needed, plus more.  I loved that we were able to bring our dogs and the yard was fenced in.  We will definitely try to stay here again if we are back in Denver; it is a great home away from home in a friendly neighborhood!"

156218,21189932,215086621,2017-11-27,31686176,Morgan,Sam was an AMAZING host and the space is exactly as it is pictured. We were greeted with flowers and champagne and spent the night sitting out by the fire pit. It was a great place to spend some quality time with my fiancé and celebrate our engagement with a couple friends. There were snacks and waters that were perfect for a midnight snack! We honestly couldn’t have asked for more! Can’t wait to come back and stay again!

Perfect size for 3 people, parking was easy and the place was located in a great part of the city.  You cannot beat the value for this location.  I would recommend staying at this place and if I go back to Denver, this will be the first place I try to rent."

Carrie did a superb job of ensuring that I could get in on arrival - very clear instructions prior to my arrival, perfectly executed. When I asked her questions, her response was nearly immediate. When I determined that the tv needed a power cord extension, she went out and purchased one. This was one of my best Airbnb experiences - thank you, Carri!"

The space is so comfortable, private, and relaxing and Cal & Dave made sure everything met our expectations and offered tips and recommendations to match the lovely amenities.
This was one of my best experiences with AirBNB, and I would definitely stay with Cal & Dave again."

I traveled alone, she was gracious enough to include me in some events with her awesome friends. It was a blast. June bug and the pugs really sweetened the deal for me. "

Communication was very good: thorough check-in instructions and info that anticipated questions one might have. The space was sparkling clean, cozy and comfy. Bed was very comfy with good sheets. Lots of closet space and dresser with plenty of room.  Lighting: overhead and 2 lamps. Bathroom was well-stocked, super-clean and very nice. Hair dryer was supplied. Many thoughtful extras: glass carafe with water upon arrival, new soap, interesting reading material. Erin and Ben are wonderful hosts and it was fun meeting their sweet family."

Pamela was a warm & inviting hostess, who was more than happy to share restaurant and sightseeing recommendations, as well as tasty, homemade food & beverages.  The house, itself, has wonderful character, a beautiful backyard, and is well-located.  Parking was a breeze (we had a rental car for driving to the mountains), and we were able to walk to a wide variety of restaurants & shops.  Our wonderful experience made us want to live in Denver!"

Thanks guys :)"

It's an easy walk from the Union Station train depot, and steps from the free downtown shuttle.  The unit is roomy and comfortable, if a bit shopworn.  Check-in and check-out were easy."
240275,36596870,536441239,2019-09-26,96878036,Anne,"Julia corresponded very promptly and check-in was easy. A private parking space with direct access to the back yard entrance was great. If you are not a dog person, probably not the place for you. The house is along a main road and the dogs are home during the day, so day napping didn’t work out; quiet enough at night. The space is clean and new, has a very comfy bed."

159700,21517962,478301649,2019-06-29,116924979,Bianca,"Allison's house is by far the best Airbnb that I have stayed at. She's a wonderful host and is incredibly sweet and helpful. Her house is just that a house. It's lived in and feels like a home. She has amazing animals and aqua life, and  it's a great place to smoke up at!"

244910,40088850,568746726,2019-11-24,100253044,Nick,"I can't say enough good things about this place. First, the location is AMAZING! Less than a block to Avanti, Brider, Highland Tap & Burger. If you're looking to be in the best spot in the best neighborhood - this is it. And it's just on the edge of downtown.

Next, it was so nicely decorated. I want the owner to decorate my house. Wow. But it was still super cozy and comfortable with all the blankets and couches and warm spaces they created.

Check-in was a breeze, everything was perfect. I only wish we had more time there. 

If you're in Denver with a big group, this is a must stay! I will be staying here again!"

My mother and her siblings were able to enjoy a wonderful little reunion, and the place was also perfect for my cousin's two young boys, who loved staying in the ""attic"" room on the 3rd story! Check in was very streamlined and efficient, and everything thoroughly cleaned and ready for our stay. There is also a basement apartment, which is completely separate from the 3 upper levels."

My friends and I truly enjoyed ourselves and we would definitely stay here again. We would surely recommend this place for future travels. However, slight renovations could make this place even more outstanding. Thank you for enriching our Denver experience!"
162,590,336422,2011-06-26,737867,Janet,My sister and I were looking for a room in Denver (way too late) the night before our arrival and heard of airbnb through another family member. Unsure of how this all works and hesitant to book without some assurance we could be accomodated at such as late date I sent Jill a message and was happy to receive a quick response. We booked and were happy with the comfortable room and gracious host. It was a short visit and was perfect for our stay.

You’re less than a mile from downtown, but it feels like a quiet street. If we ever need a house near downtown again, we’ll definitely book again. Communication was great too. We had an issue with the heat, but they had it fixed in right away."

Neighbors were quiet, surprising as this is right in the middle of DU students. Perfect location for easy access to all things DU. We had a great graduation weekend."

My only suggestion to the host would be to have extra linens laying around to accommodate more than 2 guests. 
We also didn't have wifi, but I understand they had some difficulties with a previous tenant. 
I would probably stay here again"

The location is great and walkable to many restaurants and bars. There is no AC and we were there in July where it was very hot, so unfortunately some of our family ended up moving to a hotel for the AC but for the rest of us we were ok with opening windows and fans. There is a park close by which was nice. We appreciated being able to walk to many things. The kitchen is fully stocked including some condiments. Great place! Would rent again!"
116105,16582485,366547809,2019-01-02,79455989,Alexis,We had a lovely stay at Cindy’s place. The location was ideal and Cindy was very quick to respond and attend our concerns. We did have some unforeseen circumstances during our stay but Cindy and her husband handled the situations appropriately and in a timely fashion. Would 100% recommend Cindy’s place to future guests. If we are back in Denver we will most definitely be staying here. Thank you again Cindy.

230057,32794224,459624208,2019-05-27,228547390,Connor,"Royel’s place comes as advertised, my stay was very quiet and enjoyable.

All of the other guests in the house kept to themselves and were very respectful of privacy.

The location was perfect, especially for me since I relied primarily on public transportation but if you have a car or just want to walk somewhere, downtown is about a 10-minute drive or 45-minute walk away; there are also plenty of things to within a mile radius of the Air BnB.

I was staying here alone but the room that I had stayed in (exposed brick basement) could easily fit two comfortably. The furnace in the room does come on every now and then and can get pretty loud but luckily I did not mind it; I was able to drown it out pretty quickly."

The apartment was cozy, clean, and well furnished, exactly what we needed, and in a very fun, hip, safe feeling  neighborhood. Being next to Whole Foods was the icing on the cake. We spent most of our time exploring the fabulous city and going up to Boulder, but we were so happy to have such a great place to come home to each night."

He was vey friendly and caring. We hope we can come back next time we stay in Denver!"
26821,4227772,427437551,2019-03-23,25748735,Shawn,"Lynne’s place is a small little bungalow in a great location. She is extremely kind and provided all the necessities for our stay, including beer in the fridge! Coming from a much, much smaller city, we really enjoying having easy access to parking and a little fenced yard for our dog. It isn’t a huge place but work well for a couple with a baby or dog. Would recommend it anyone looking for a comfortable stay in Denver."

171205,22596470,436284783,2019-04-12,47118271,Bryan,"This house is super relaxing, clean and perfectly located. We were in town for a conference and a 10 minute Lyft or a 20 minute bus ride got us to everything we needed downtown. Alicia and Scott were very welcoming and friendly the few times we ran into them. We couldn’t have asked for better hosts."

The apartment was super clean and comfy; it was well stocked with coffee, beer, and snacks; they had an iron and laundry attached to the unit which was a huge score; and check-in was a complete breeze. If I am every back in Denver, this is my spot!"
5101,665622,43510224,2015-08-20,13701234,Ryan,"Becky's place is in a great location! It's an adorable neighborhood, everything is very walkable, and there is good food/drink nearby. The keyless entry into the apartment is very convenient. Becky was very responsive to our needs. The apartment is cute, but it was a lot like staying at a friends place. When we arrived there were some damp sheets in the wash and towels in the dryer. I folded the towels and threw the sheets in the dryer. Not a big deal, but something I'm not necessarily used to seeing when doing BnB."
50592,8071897,66184188,2016-03-20,57062671,Nicholas,Awesome place to stay. My friends and I couldn't have asked for anything better.. Especially for the price. Would definitely go back again.

No issues. The house was super cute with a lot of character. Catherine provided shower stuff, towels and water by our bedside. The house was super close to downtown which made it easy for us to explore. The bed was comfortable and we had no issues with our stay there. Definitely recommend :) "

141215,19751421,534528645,2019-09-22,219437089,Alexa,Troys place was amazing! We checked in late due to a late flight but check in was fine and it was easy to find the back entrance. The house is super cute & the couch is super comfortable. The shower was a little confusing but Troy provides a manual with photos on how to operate it. There is a washer & dryer that was great so that I was able to leave with clean clothes. The backyard was cute to sit outside & hang out after a long day out in the mountains. The only thing that I did not enjoy was the fact that the nest was locked & the AC only worked at specific times and did not go lower than 73 degrees. Other than that we would definitely stay here again!
35804,5649152,97199480,2016-08-26,60806265,Harriet,"My husband and I were here for a few days before our daughter's wedding.  We didn't spend much time in the unit because of pre wedding activities.  The space was as advertised, very clean& Terra was helpful & gracious."

15298,2139342,67331425,2016-03-28,44767135,Christine,"Jeffrey was a wonderful host. He greeted us on arrival at the front door and checked in the next afternoon to make sure we weren't wanting for anything - which we weren't!  He left us a list of nearby places to eat and enjoy ourselves.  The apartement was welcoming and charming, beautifully decorated but quite comfortable. It was just like coming home.  The neighborhood is a quiet residential area, a short drive to many restaurants and other activities, such as the Denver Botanical Garden and the Denver Wildlife Refuge.  We'd stay again in a heartbeat."

224112,31333659,537458940,2019-09-28,50292278,Margaret,"I'm not sure I can sing the praises of Mary and her place highly enough. I have been to a lot of Airbnb's over the years, and have loved many of them, but Mary's is easily my favorite. The casita is designed gorgeously, with beautiful furnishings and linens. The bed was super comfortable and the space was CLEAN. Mary uses natural cleaning products so it smells lovely in the Casita. She also provides a ton of amenities including two kinds of coffee makers and complementary drinks and snacks. There is a great book with restaurants within walking distance. The neighborhood is safe, very cute and close to everything. Oh, and the outdoor gardens and sitting areas are gorgeous and peaceful! 

Mary is available to you if you need anything but gives plenty of privacy. If you are considering Mary's place, just do it. You won't regret it."

The location is just perfect. We barely used Lyft/Uber and even bus cause we can walk to pretty much everywhere. But if you prefer to take a bus the bus stop is very close to the house.
Rebbeca is a very nice person and she gave us great tips about where to go and where to eat. We definitely recommend this place"
83441,13171401,91880906,2016-08-07,7883934,Lauren,"Such a great place to stay!  The room and house were just as described with plenty of space. I loved having breakfast available in the morning, that's usually something I grocery shop for when traveling.  Being from Texas I wasn't prepared for the cold front (70 degrees) and Shelby lent me a fleece.  She was very accommodating when I arrived at 11:30pm at night...FYI it takes 1-1.5 hour from the airport for evening trains.  I borrowed a phone charger as well, they had everything and were very generous.

Sunnyside is convenient to downtown, I would definitely recommend their home!"

Sprouts grocery store is right across the street, there’s tons of restaurants and bars nearby, and a park down the street. Cerebral Brewing is also across the street and has amazing beer. The space was great! We enjoyed the hot tub and the shower upstairs is especially roomy. The Hosts are super easy to get ahold of with any questions and check in was a breeze because they have a pin code access door. The kitchen was perfect for cooking in while we were there and had everything we needed and more."

There is a guest refrigerator, small snacks, water, a mini coffee pot, toiletries, and more!  It was so quiet, I felt like I had the place to myself all week!  The house is located in a decent neighborhood, and I felt safe throughout my stay.  Restaurants and shopping were not too far away, and I had an easy time getting back and forth to my seminar each day.  Highly recommended - all my associates paying $100+/night for a hotel room were quite jealous!  "

We always found a parking space. Harold and John were very cordial. They did an excellent job creating their basement level into a cozy apartment, with all the amenities. I never looked for something I couldn't find. My husband and I stayed there for a week, and we entertained both our grown sons almost every evening. Plenty of room for all of us to play cards, eat dinner, watch TV, etc. The place was clean as a whistle, and everything is new. We'll definitely will stay here again."

comfortable and cozy spaces to relax as well as an updated,well appointed kitchen with lots of amenities. Janna is a super host! She was quick to respond  to our queries, providing helpful information/instructions in advance and in a binder at the suite.

Either you’re in walking distance of most places or an Uber/Lyft won’t cost you much. You’re really meant to feel at home for sure. Everything was clean and tidy. The courtyard is a really nice hang out area as well.

Quick and clear responses to this first time AirBNB renter.  So many provided items made packing a breeze and reduced overpacking or ordering of toiletries, or household items.  Parking, although not included, was never an issue on street very close to front entry.  Tons of closet and drawer space - no need to live out of suitcase.  Highly recommend!"

The location is perfect - There are more than enough restaurants and things to do in the LoHi neighborhood and downtown Denver is walkable or between a $6-$9 Lyft ride. I highly recommend Katie's place! Thanks Katie!

It is so convenient to get to the airport, and Stephanie was so kind and accommodating!  Even though it was later in the evening when we arrived, Stephanie took the time to show us to our room.   Her home is very stylish and comfortable.  She even provided us with bottled water and chocolates by our bed.  We would definitely recommend Stephanie's place for anyone needing a great stay in Denver!"

We didn't get a chance to meet but they communicated everything we needed in advance and were quick to respond to our questions. It was very modern and stylish. My wife talked about it often. This was my wife and my first Airbnb and because of our stay here, it won't be our last."

The layout of the place is spacious and it was actually much bigger than I expected it to be. The beds were comfy and the couch was the perfect spot to chill after a long day.There is a big backyard with a grill, fire pit, and chairs, which made for a cool spot to hangout in the evening. The apartment is in a great location, it was so close to tons of incredible restaurants and bars. We would definitely like to stay here again next time we're in town."

On entering this house we immediately felt better and more relaxed. It's the perfect size for a couple (maybe a few more) and has a very homey feel to it. Eliza was wonderful and quick to respond to any question or need that I had. And the bed.... Possibly the most comfortable thing I've slept on in years. Temper-pedic if I'm not mistaken?  I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it for anyone wanting to stay in central Denver. "

The furnace went out right before my stay & she responded back with space heater in every room. Couldn’t even tell the furnace wasn’t working. & the next morning she sent people out to fix it. Very accommodating. Communication was great, she kept checking in with us. If you are going to Denver this is the place! Not only is the place beautiful the host is great."

I didn't have any problems with my room or getting in and out of the house. He provided me with keys so that I could reenter the house at my convenience. He filled me in on the hot spots to check out in Denver and also offered advice on the best ways to move about his city. He even had some  bud for me that saved me from making an immediate stop at the dispensary.  His Brita Water Filter provided me with the best tap water Ive ever tasted.  Overall I enjoyed my stay and I would definitely consider staying at his place again when I return to Denver.

Whether it be a coffee shop or liquor store directly across the street, a Trader Joe's just a few blocks down, or for a highly rated Italian bistro directly neighboring you, you will find it hard to not fill any amenities or needs you may have. She is quick with her responses and just a down right friendly person to communicate with. You're welcomed into a clean home and the stay is definitely worth the price. The grape vine out front also has some of the sweetest grapes I've ever tasted. Those, of course, are also included with your stay . Thank you again for offering us your great home for our Colorado vacation!!"

17086,2361919,22483669,2014-11-08,14502419,Vanessa,"This was my 1st airbnb experience and it was perfect for my 3-month stay in the area for a rotation for graduate school. Upon arrival I was blessed with Annette's generosity and friendship.  She was so kind as to invite me to dinner various times throughout my stay where I had the chance to meet her great family, friends, and neighbors as well as enjoy some fascinating stories. She is also very easy to get a hold of if you need any help or need to borrow anything. The studio was perfect, especially with such a great kitchenette if you like to cook! The location is ideal with easy access to interstates to take you wherever your heart desires (& trust me, I hiked on many beautiful trails throughout Colorado). The surrounding neighborhood is safe and charming. I already miss it and would definitely stay here again! "
197124,26062987,352790840,2018-11-25,92170618,Lakasia,"This home is absolutely beautiful and very clean. The only issue we had was there were no face towels to bathe with, which we quickly resolved on a trip to Walmart. To clear any confusion for future renters, their is no master suite! The private bathroom is actually located in a bedroom with the 2 queen beds. So make appropriate sleep arrangements with that in mind if traveling as a group or family. The house legit has every piece of cookware you could possibly need in order to prepare the largest to the smallest of meals. The openness of the living room/kitchen makes it the perfect home for entertaining. The house is NO SMOKING INDOORS & OUTDOORS. However the owners allowed our recreational marijuana users in the group to enjoy themselves in the garage only. I definitely recommend this rental for groups up to 12 people."

219524,30110319,512733693,2019-08-18,134427836,Alison,"Diana’s place was very cool! It was a great location and you can’t beat a patio like that in the city. We visited on a very hot weekend and the air conditioning unit couldn’t keep up but it didn’t prevent us from enjoying the space. 

It is great for couples but as 3 friends who didn’t want to share beds, the sleeping arrangement was a bit odd."

Everything was as described in the listing and she was very accommodating and even let us check-in early because the previous guest left earlier. Since the suite is downstairs, you can definitely hear when others are on the main floor and the sounds from the plumbing so it’s something to keep in mind if you’re sensitive to noise. But we had no issues with it whatsoever and would recommend this place to others!"

We very much enjoyed our stay in Denver and having a place like yours available to stay during our visit made it that much better. We wish we had more time!  The accommodations were exactly as described. The location was fantastic for everything we wanted to do.  The coffee at Huckleberry Roasters is outstanding.  What more can we add? Everything in the listing description was as advertised. We will certainly stay again in future trips to Denver while visiting family. Thanks again!
115557,16440552,285419178,2018-07-03,117497450,James,"Michael was a fantastic host! We requested a few random things while we were in town (extra clothes hangers, an umbrella for unforeseen rain, etc.), and he was always very responsive. He also gave us several great suggestions for local sights and restaurants -- we weren't able to make it to all of them, but we're looking forward to checking them out the next time we're in Denver. The place itself was clean and comfortable, just as you'd expect from the description and the photos.

Thanks for being so friendly and helpful during our stay!"

139188,19503543,290017847,2018-07-13,9721261,Jessy,"The pictures do not give this place justice. It is so romantic and every thing is beautiful in this house inside and out. We only stayed one night and that’s the only negative I have because we wished we could of stayed longer. The space is great for entertaining and reconnecting with your loved ones. We cooked a very nice meal of lobster and steak and ate on the porch. We were able to walk to get some groceries and beer. It’s a great location and lots going on but the porch and hot tub area is very private. We enjoyed a movie while in the hot tub. We went across the street the following morning to have some coffee and off to the Irish bar for lunch and cocktails. I loved every minute and can’t wait to go back. Kinga was very friendly, accommodating, and overall a wonderful host!"

Just enough for one night. Bed was a little uncomfortable for us, but like I said, it was for one night and I’m pregnant so really no bed is comfortable at this point! They left a few snacks for us and coffee which is always nice! Thanks!"

It is also a short Uber or Lyft to downtown. The house itself is amazing! It has everything you’d need for your stay. It is high tech and went above and beyond our standards for a weekend away.  It is very stylish but also incredibly functional. I would love to stay here again! Thank you! "

56607,8760285,296422941,2018-07-25,3629537,Irene,"Matt’s apartment is more beautiful and spacious than the photos! It’s a really nice and clean place to stay with tasteful decor, plush beds, plenty of pillows and towels among more. Having our own garage was a big plus too. We had our little 9 month old baby with us and they even had a pack n play for us which was amazing. It’s a 10-15 Minute Drive go the main downtown area such as the Clyfford Still museum but it’s easy to drive around in Denver. "

He went the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable and was so happy to help with recommendations for eating out. The house was cozy and clean with coffee, milk, juice, and cereal provided. The beds were comfortable. I loved the patio in the back with space to do yoga or quiet contemplation. Loved the fire pit and wood that was provided."

238083,35415091,559750921,2019-11-04,44668961,Andrew,"My girlfriend and I came to Denver to celebrate our anniversary and we couldn't have chosen a better location. Anne's place is clean, stylish, and in the best location in downtown Denver. Having both Union Station and Whole Foods next door is every millenial's dream. The views are absolutely stunning both day and night as you can look out to the Rockies or people watch as the trains go by. The amenities are also fantastic with state of the art gym and heated pool. We absolutely recommend checking out this place for anyone's trip to Denver! It absolutely made our trip there perfect!"
141933,19848263,231743114,2018-02-02,95348677,Kayla,"Tom and Maria’s place was excellent. The space : clean, comfortable, quiet, private, and packed with everything needed for a short or extended stay. 
The location : For the purposes of my stay, 20 minute drive from everywhere I needed to be. Also, restaurants, grocery stores, coffee shops all within walking distance. 
The hospitality : Tom and Maria were very kind and insured I was comfortable and had everything I needed. All questions were answered and lovely local suggestions and information was provided with a smile. 
Check In/Out : Seamless! Tom and Maria communicated clearly and quickly.

I’d be happy to stay here again and again. Highly recommend! Thanks again, Tom and Maria!"

Checking in and out was easy and instructions were clear. Her house is beautiful and very clean/organized. The beds were very comfortable. We loved that she provided things like shampoo/conditioner, coffee, board games, as well as use of the washer/dryer and detergent. It was perfect for our group of 7 adults and my 2 year old. Our favorite part was probably the big, beautiful park right down the street. We also loved that it was a quick and easy drive to downtown. We had a great time in Denver, thanks to Margarita and her lovely home!"

The space was beautiful and comfy. I'm quite a towel and pillow snob, but the linens (and all the accommodations) far exceeded expectations! And the breakfast!!! There are no words to describe its deliciousness! We would gladly have paid twice what we did to stay there. "

The building is in the perfect spot for a week spent in Denver. make sure to check out Ophelia's Electric Soapbox right around the corner, catch a baseball game two blocks away, 5 dispensaries within a block and a half, and all the great local bars. Thank you once more for amazing place Ben."

Great location that made it easy to get to sights we wanted to see, the option to do laundry was invaluable, and check in and out was as easy as coming and going from your own home. Do recommend to anyone who is looking for a more immersive experience than one finds at some hotel chain."

Up the stairs we went to find our comfortable bedroom, cooled by an air conditioner.  The bathroom is nearby, just a couple feet away in the hall.  In the morning, I found a new favorite large coffee cup.   The location of the home is outstanding, because it's within walking distance to all of downtown.  There is a bike and scooter program available if you want to leave the car parked on the street in front of the house.  The hosts, Rob and Mandy, are fast with communication and warmly greet you.  Will stay again...  Actually, just booked it again."
69860,11048504,298762582,2018-07-29,157948726,Julie,We loved this place! Jason was a very friendly and welcoming host and the house was just amazing. We loved the location within walking distance to the grocery store and restaurants and the back yard and hot tub was a great place to hang out. I would definitely recommend this place.
87810,13542997,85108428,2016-07-10,78079265,Paula,"We had a wonderful time staying at Kathryn's place!  It was even lovelier than the pictures suggested.  There is an open floorplan and the comfortable living room area had lots of great sunlight during the day.  The bedroom area is separated from the rest of the apartment by a partial wall, which makes it feel cozy and secluded.  There's also a great porch, with views of the city.  The kitchen is well-equipped for cooking, and there is a Safeway grocery store right around the corner.

In fact, everything we could possibly want to do in Denver was walking distance from her home.  The location was perfect for us, since we were planning to walk everywhere.

Kathryn was very helpful with suggestions for our trip before we arrived, and left little notes around the apartment with more details.  Our flight into Denver was delayed, but she was very flexible about the check-in time and waited up pretty late to meet us when we arrived.  We had mentioned that it was our anniversary and we were planning to go to a Rockies game -- and she left us a very sweet anniversary gift of chocolates and wine, plus seat cushions to use at the baseball game.  She also had a variety of books about the area, and a list of her recommendations for local things to do, see, and eat.  Overall, there were so many thoughtful touches that made Kathryn a really wonderful host."
200683,26520064,355361599,2018-12-03,39658186,Travis,"Absolutely loved this space, it went above and beyond.  Others' positive reviews of Doug's bnb were accurate and I had to add mine to the list. It was roomy, incredibly clean and comfy and full of useful amentities. Doug was friendly and prvoided good suggestions for restaurants etc, and accommodated our extra guests/blow up matress. The neighborhood was beautiful yet also direct and convenient to get to downtown from. The value of this space is insane."

Great place for the night to explore Denver"

93767,14027297,147409628,2017-04-26,358236,Jeff,"Great location, provides bikes, close to train and walking downtown was easy ( about 30 minutes.) The home was very clean.  The place needs better lightening. It has only ceiling lights  and bulbs were burned out making it difficult to see well in the evening. The bathroom had a broken toilet seat and only one towel and one washcloth was provided despite a booking of 4 nights. There was no bathmat and stepping out of the tub on a tile floor was slippery. I also appreciate a microwave when I travel as most often I am only using the kitchen to heat up leftovers from restaurants."

19371,3231657,521194630,2019-08-31,25368840,Salvatore,"An ideal place for an extended stay in downtown Denver. The historic loft is a spacious, nicely furnished and well maintained space.  Easy walking distance to downtown, restaurants, shops, parks and entertainment venues. The host is easy to communicate with and responsive. A great place to stay and experience the lifestyle and all of the amenities of a thriving urban center."
40593,6515185,38874916,2015-07-19,35918670,Brandon,Kirk and Bryce were great host. For starters the room is very clean and looks just like the picture. They also tried to accommodate me since my flight was a little early. I would definitely recommend them to anyone. I really had a great time! 
124522,17556772,154942153,2017-05-26,39981081,Hannah,"I would definitely stay here again. It was very easy to reach Harold, and the apartment is just lovely. There were many nice little touches, and it was spotlessly clean. Everything was updated and modern. Thank you for letting us stay here! "
21298,3479122,82064335,2016-06-26,67347337,Mike,"This is the greatest place to stay if you are going to Coors Field or any place in or around Blake or Larimer Street.  All within easy walking distance.  Literally a perfect location.  Cheaper than hotels too and closer!  It has parking for your car which in Denver is a HUGE bonus.  

The only complaint I have and it is a small one is the bed made a lot of noise when you moved because there it was a mattress on a piece of wood.  Believe me, that was the only issue and a small one at that!

Sam, we would have washed our 1 coffee mug and the coffee press but there were no sponges or dish soap.  Sorry!

It's just not worth staying in a hotel if you go to Denver.  You should stay here!

"

The location is ideal with alot around it in a more quiet area of denver. We took advantage of the recommendations provided. Loved staying here, hopefully will be back!!"

54735,8649742,65746332,2016-03-16,17561,Tom,"This is the second time I've been able to stay at/with Janet.  The apt. and building are very well located if you need or want to be in downtown Denver.  In my case, this has worked very well with conferences in the downtown, but Janet's place is at an affordable price.  I also find it easy to park in the Pavilion, and suggest using Parking Panda there.  Thanks again, J.  I hope we can have a long conversation one of these days."
141819,19828479,431236594,2019-03-31,5475588,Yoli,"Mark is at the property a lot to get landscaping materials for his job, so the carriage house is much less private than it appears in the listing. Mark seems very nice, but he was definitely there much more than I expected. I was also surprised that he became rude when I made a few mistakes at checkout, even though I followed the house rules. Overall, a disappointing stay, especially for the price."
64064,9682108,481967028,2019-07-05,3806506,Colleen,"This house has a really cool design both inside and out.  You’ll love the comfy bedroom and beautiful bathroom upstairs as well as the kitchen table and dining area,  as well as more space to relax in the basement  and the cute backyard."

158073,21355645,251284307,2018-04-07,180211463,Jody,"Hugh is a very accommodating, friendly and gracious host. He was genuinely thoughtful and added nice touches like leaving bowls out for us in the morning. 
Humphrey, who is a Saint Bernard, is extremely friendly, gentle and very in your space. He was our favorite part of the BnB stay but I want to let others know that you will have to physically shut and lock your door if you do not want his company. My dog loved him and loved to play tug of war. She is a 30lb dachshund/lab mix and it was a treat to watch. 
For the price this BnB is a catch, but if you are looking for kitchen accommodations I wouldn’t recommend it. The kitchen and appliances weren’t very clean or user friendly. Overall the house has a general dirtiness to it except for our direct accommodations which were the bedroom and shared bathroom. 
Clean towels, bedding, chrome cast, local tips and amazing WIFi were given!!
Thank you so much for having us."

I love that part of town. Great food! Everything is walkable! The loft was beautiful, modern, amazing natural light, lots of parking, easy to find and get to -- and the owner was great! Very nice and easy to get a hold of :) I will recommend the loft to friends who come to town and visit for sure!"

7742,834896,38705342,2015-07-18,8473111,Anna,We really enjoyed our stay at Nan's home. The home is clean and very nicely decorated. We felt quite at home. There is a city park across the street great for running/walking/biking. The home is walking distance to good restaurants. It was a great way to start our Colorado summer vacation. Nan's directions/instructions were very clear. We had no problems. She is very welcoming and a good communicator. There was a little construction going on while we were there. I can only imagine how nice the common area is going to look once the work is done. We would gladly stay at Dwell Contender the next time we are in Denver! 
143548,20033468,462076251,2019-06-01,256089534,Douglas,Place was great very close to downtown and the trolley.

9584,1035821,403423832,2019-01-20,79387153,Sarah,"Steve’s place was fantastic for our small group! The location was great, a quick 10-15 minute uber ride downtown to all of our activities! The house was the perfect size for the 5 of us- we didn’t feel crowded at all and everyone pretty much had their own bed. Two notes: the bathroom light seemed to be out so that didn’t help with getting ready and the front door lock (from the inside) didn’t feel that secure but it still locked."
150496,20914531,313073639,2018-08-24,181617324,Eli,Cute little apartment in 5 points neighborhood. The space was really nice and had a patio in the back which was a nice plus. Would definitely stay again!

77104,12365447,152671337,2017-05-17,93585424,Jenna,"Very easy check in process. Very easy to follow manual for the house and has suggestions for different things to do. Communication from host was awesome. The place was extremely clean and easy to find. There was absolutely no surprises, the place was described very accurately in the listing. Would definitely recommend to stay at the Urban Farmhouse! "

132951,18778248,516677517,2019-08-24,284033329,Bri,"Kimmy was such a wonderful host and was very flexible with my boyfriend and I. We stayed in the silver room which was spacious and comfortable. Everything was kept incredibly clean, and to top that she has the two most adorable dogs who are SO well behaved (I honestly miss them). The location is clean and quiet but isnt too far from downtown Denver, which is a nice balance. Overall we truly enjoyed our experience and we'd definitely stay again!"
105520,15507830,313592972,2018-08-25,203608022,Matthew,"such a nice place to stay. bob and his family are very nice and hospitable, and you won’t notice them if you choose not to. not necessarily within “walking distance” of a whole lot, but if you’re up for a bit of a trip, it’s not that bad. plus uber is like $6-$12 to all of the shopping and food districts. overall, it was great, and everything i could need out of a rental was taken care of!"
86222,13449331,240440497,2018-03-04,58110609,Mandy,"Super clean, comfy pillowy beds, and thoughtful details that make an easy stay. 

Awesome for families with babies: strollers, a pack n play with mattress, and a high chair. We didn’t have to worry about bringing any of that with us on the airplane. Thanks Gary!"
200201,26415492,488806799,2019-07-15,31894,Patricia,"The loft is in a historic building (with the plaque to prove it) in a central location just off the 16th Street Mall. My husband and I loved the feeling of openness with the two-story windows and big loft bedroom after being on the road for several weeks. Zach was very accommodating to a special request we had and was one of the most laid-back hosts we've ever encountered on Airbnb; his only checkout instructions were to ""lock the door when you leave."" Although the place was pricier than we would have liked for just the two of us, we would stay again if we wanted to be in the Central Business District. Two notes: There's a handy parking garage right next door to the lofts, but be sure to follow the self-pay instructions exactly when you exit. And this may not matter to you, but the host does keep his own items in the closet and dresser. There's still plenty of room to hang things as well as a bench in the bedroom for your luggage."
121452,17185409,313088382,2018-08-24,50474658,Jessica,Super clean place that is very convenient to downtown. We had a private car and there was plenty of parking. Laura was very easy to talk to and we would definitely stay here again!
17271,2441525,124803449,2017-01-02,18290958,Jenna,"This is a very cute house in a very charming part of Denver.  I suggest you check out Tennyson St if you decide to stay at Juan's, as it has many great restaurants and bars and is an easy 10 min walk away. We cooked the majority of our meals in the kitchen here, which worked out fine. If you are a planner and able, it might be a good idea to bring some extra spices, but the home is equipped with the basics and there are plenty of grocery stores nearby. The beds are comfy and the house overall was just as described, charming with a lot of artistic flare.  We enjoyed our stay here and are looking forward to our next trip to Denver!"
210074,28316749,445113726,2019-04-28,106926003,Simone,"Amazing house & even better hosts. The lock malfunctioned so we couldn't get in, and Andrew was there in less than 10 minutes! We had a bachelorette party of 16 people and it fit everyone comfortably and we all had an amazing time."
56680,8797683,77926044,2016-06-04,2800388,Jean,Janna was so helpful and welcoming! We loved the beautiful home and the neighborhood is amazing!

205675,27523722,514664877,2019-08-21,149611770,Valentine,The problem is that you sleep  in the inclined bed and the night you think of how not to fall off it.. it s all so very hot in this tiny room.
67341,10266757,210313065,2017-11-08,115664148,Todd,"If you’re looking to be central and secluded, this is the spot. Right in the middle of hip Five Points and a short walk to many of Denver’s other happening neighborhoods. The cottage is super clean and modern with all you need for a short or long stay.

Check-in was a snap!"

11045,1363517,6288664,2013-08-06,7684238,Sara,"I stayed here with two other friends for a weekend in Denver.  It was a really cute apartment, perfect size for three friends.  We shared the large queen bed and one of us slept on the couch.  It had a nice kitchen and plenty of space for storage (where we kept our luggage). The location was perfect for us since we were visiting a friend who lived nearby and there are some cute restaurants/bars nearby. It may be a little far for some folks who are trying to walk to downtown.  There is a lot of parking space available in front of the apartment.  It also had a great little outdoor space with a patio where we hung out.  Very nice, safe neighborhood.  "
156272,21189932,291878299,2018-07-16,21369566,Jennifer,"the Railroad Overall Laundry is about as unique a place to stay as you can find in Denver. Drenched in natural light, original exposed brick and distictive decorating style. Sam has created an experience for her guests that cannot be duplicated. "

131339,18550517,153762600,2017-05-21,114530869,Nicole," Overall it was a good stay Tom was a pretty good hosts sent me everything I needed immediately to enter property /asked often  if there was anything I needed . It's very much a real neighborhood one of the most ""urban""areas I've stayed in ever in an Airbnb  which wasn't bad reminded me of home Boston mass 
 The only other thing I would say is the furniture is a little out of date ....but other than that everything was clean  which was most important to us.."
167955,22303051,511657693,2019-08-17,113248585,Sam,Great place for what we needed. The location is excellent and the hosts are outstanding to work with! Highly recommend this place.

The list of interesting places in the neighborhood to visit was full of delightful places to check out and was much appreciated as a way to begin exploring the great city of Denver. The appartment was well stocked with all the basic necessities. When we return, we hope Lynne's home is available. A truly great experience. Thanks Lynne!"

32543,4978830,40095854,2015-07-28,20378787,Belinda,"Araceli was a perfect host.  She waited to let me in for a late arrival and showed me around the house when we got there.  The house was much more beautiful and spacious than the pictures.  We had 9 people staying there and everyone was comfortable.  There are many amenities including the outdoor trampoline, grill, large backyard, patio and lovely outdoor dining table.  Inside the house are several areas to gather, 5 bathrooms, a large bathtub in the master bedroom, a huge kitchen, a great laundry room, a pool table, hockey table and treadmill in the basement and more.  I will definitely stay there again  Everything was perfect!  A+++++++++"

It is an easy 2-block walk to Tennyson St and the variety of restaurants that can be found there. The garage accommodates a small car...I was scared to try it, but street parking was easy. One does hear traffic sounds when inside the apt. I was not used to that coming from a small town in the Blue Ridge mountains. Overall it is a great apt in a great location!"

I loved that it is walking distance to my favorite breakfast spot, Jelly! Check in was super easy and I liked having a private parking lot in the back alley. We were a little unsure where to park at first because there was no  numbered spot for apartment 1, so we just parked in unnumbered spots. The beds were amazing! So comfortable! The decoration and layout of the space was so cozy and inviting. I really liked the toiletries and hair dryer that were available. The patio was very relaxing, with a nice view of the neighborhood. If I'm ever staying in Denver again, this will be my go-to spot."

He was super accommodating and made communicating needs and questions easy. The place is clean and welcoming. There are many stores within walking distance with the closest being a gas station like half a block up the street. Overall great stay. Will be returning in the future to check out new artwork added to the spot.

BUT John deserves an amazing review so here it goe (Website hidden by Airbnb) wish I could give 500 stars.  Everything was as per the listing for the accommodations & communications, checkin/out, etc. were so easy. On top of all that John went our of his way to help/offer help given my special circumstances as to why I needed to stay here for a week (my daughter had knee surgery and needed a place to recover outside her 3rd floor apt & me a place to stay while I helped her recover). He made sure we had everything we might need, offered extra help if needed & made us feel right at home. This made her recovery that much easier.  I will never be able to thank this host  (John) enough and we are so grateful for the opportunity to stay at his place through AirBnB. Definitely will look to book again for my Denver travels."

We wish there were better airflow in the basement space, but really, that was such a small thing.  My 6’5” other half couldn’t stand up 100% in the basement space, (Website hidden by Airbnb) a Denver basement space. We didn’t have much time to spend with the hosts, but what we did get was amazing!!  If we ever get to Denver again, we will probably, most likely, stay here again.

My favorite things was the aromatherapy mister that was placed in the room. Unfortunately, now I know that I've been missing something in my life and will have to go out and buy one. Stephanie and her husband were incredibly welcoming and engaging from the first second I arrived until I left. Stephanie even went out of her way to fix the room up early when she learned that I was already in town, resulting in her running late to her own appointments.  I couldn't have asked for a better first experience with airbnb. "

Short walk to lots of shops, breweries, and restaurants plus easy access to interstates and highways to visit all the great town around Denver. The space is exactly as described. Thin walls, so we could hear the neighbors, but the fan provided in the bedroom helped drown out noise when we were ready to sleep. Jennifer provided great information for our stay and easy access for check-in. Easy on street parking with use of provided permit. "

It was in a quiet neighborhood, but at the same time nearby enough restaurants and things to do if we wanted the option of going out. Getting into the apartment was simple, and we were able to get comfortable quickly. Each room had its own heater, so it was nice to be able to control the temperature of individual rooms depending on where we were in the apartment. We did not get a chance to cook while we were there, but there was a great kitchen as well. If we visit Denver again, we would love to stay here again."

224655,31490273,554559554,2019-10-26,133108357,Samantha,Great location! Easy walk to restaurants and quick ride to downtown. There is room for improvement with cleaning—I believe someone must live here when it isn’t being used as an Airbnb.
105018,15469884,153671819,2017-05-21,19692157,Ajla,AWESOME Location and the place was very cute and clean. Would totally recommend staying here.

29046,4388297,66467590,2016-03-22,16180269,Shawn,Was there for 1 night and I enjoyed my stay with Carolyn and Matt. Everything was within walking distance; I used the super shuttle to get to and from the airport. Took me around an hour to get from the airport with 7 other passengers and 30 mins to airport with 3 other passengers. The air mattress and bedding was very comfy and Carolyn was very accommodating. Very good experience in a beautiful city.
9199,923994,5579374,2013-07-07,3381001,Jen,We had a lovely time at Rob's Big Red House!  Rob was a great host.  He took the time to reach out to me before the trip and assist with activities in Denver and assure that we had everything we needed before we landed. Once we met with him he walked us through the house which was very well equipped with everything we needed for a perfect vacation including bikes to get around town. The house is very quaint and eclectic. The rooms were comfy and the jacuzzi was a great way to end the day. I would highly recommend staying here!!! The neighborhood nearby has plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance as well.

13707,1905596,134313166,2017-02-26,14251538,Susan,"For starters, Annette's home could not have been more ideally situated for us, convenient for its proximity to our son's home, to the Tennyson St. district, to I70, to the mountains.  Her home is large and charming, situated on a very lremarkable lot on a bit of a rise--quite impressive, especially in a city neighborhood. (We were there in February and March but would enjoy seeing the place in spring and summer.) After a brief period of adjustment to our actual accommodations, we grew to like the place very much; it became home to us for the ten days or so that we were there.  When our plans changed abruptly, Annette was able to keep us housed for another three nights, and while this resulted in an issue with Airbnb, Annette (though away herself) went to some trouble to help work out the matter for us.  She and her staff (and two sons) were not only welcoming and helpful but pleasant and interesting people as well.  Though we are not especially thrilled with Airbnb, we liked Annette and her home and would be happy to visit her there again. The place is quirky in several ways, but enjoyably so."

53154,8420315,187284528,2017-08-26,111596293,Chris,"This was by far the best Airbnb experience I've had. Lori and her family made me, my gf, and our dog feel at home. Her pets are amazing and the location is great. We stayed here for four weeks while relocating to Denver and couldn't have asked for anything better. I highly recommend this place to everyone."

214266,29186188,401933908,2019-01-16,11676416,Jean-Paul,"We really loved the location, how Nicholas was able to flex check in and check out times to accommodate our schedule. The place was very clean and having two separate rooms instead of a room and a sofa bed (although you can sleep in the sofa too!), made a huge difference to us. Thank you so much!"
24925,3992779,168625220,2017-07-09,25866799,Mary Caroline,Elizabeth was one of the most kind and accommodating hosts I have ever worked with. Her house is in a fantastic area of town with quaint historic homes and lots of tree lined streets. We also loved that it was walking distance to a Whole Foods. We could Uber to anywhere else in the city for under $10. This was the perfect spot for a Denver weekend getaway!
99223,14836832,145933297,2017-04-20,125692990,Andrew,"Location cannot be beat.  Walkable from union station, very short walk to FreeMallRide. It has a retro charm.  It's an ageing home with reasonable updates, have an open mind and you won't regret staying here.  FYI, if you're over 6', the shower is a bit short.

Has everything you need."

It's in a gated community (coded gateway), has a coded front door, and is in an upscale neneighborhood. We felt very safe, and Jason is an outstanding host."
162325,21753893,219933686,2017-12-19,773615,Rick,"This space is fantastic - warm, cozy, inviting, beautifully decorated and clean!  The colors, art work and furniture are all as advertised and presented; this is a perfectly beautiful place to spend a day or a longer stay.  Everything you could reasonably want in a place to stay is available.  In Ellen's absence Kristin (the substitute host) was easy to communicate with and was very informative.  My guests and I had a perfectly delightful time in our five nights staying here.  I recommend the space without hesitation!"

It was perfect for a girls weekend in the city.  Close to Downtown and the Rino area which has loads of places to eat.  We all enjoyed our stay very much and look forward to coming back.

131112,18509437,265610703,2018-05-17,121041237,Tj,"If needing a place in the perfect location of Denver, this is the place!  My husband loved running in the nearby parks every morning.  I am a lover of french pressed coffee and was happy to see one in Paul's kitchen.  We never got to enjoy the balcony but sure it would have been nice to sit and have a glass of wine there.  The street was packed with parked cars along both sides of the street, so it was nice to have a side parking lot to park at night, otherwise hunting for a place to put our vehicle would have been difficult.  This is the second time using airbnb, and continue to be happy with it.  It is a much better way to travel then hotels!"

205699,27543790,328986437,2018-09-27,80985974,Anna,"The place is very nice, clean, and spacious. A few things to keep in mind if it matter: it's a bit of a walk to downtown Denver, but Lyft/Uber service are very easy and relatively cheap in Denver -- it's a ~5-15min ride to attractions; there is no grocery store in walking distance, so you'd need a ride if you'd like to make full use of the kitchen; and there is no laundry in the place. On a positive note, it's very quite and nice to sleep there, the hosts are nice, easy to communicate with, and have a lovely space for you to stay."
154775,21120569,251334589,2018-04-07,122012871,Adrian,The place was beautiful and in a quiet neighborhood not too far from downtown. Lorissa was a great host that lets you have plenty of privacy during your stay.

Check in was easy and everything you could possibly need is already there in the apartment. The little sitting area staring out the window was probably my favorite part! I will definitely be back here and recommend this to everyone! You won’t be disappointed!

I would highly recommend her place!"

We also had a delicious breakfast to look forward to each morning made by Ling.  (highly suggest the granola and yoghurt! Mmm mmm).
Beautiful house, lovely host! Highly recommend saying here!

206650,27702373,348161225,2018-11-12,15487796,Andy,"Vincent and Melissa’s place was an absolutely great stay.  I came to Denver for work with a friend but arrived a few days early to see the Arts District, and wow, what a great introduction.  I stayed in a super-cool loft which was by far the best room in the house (if you don’t mind a narrow iron staircase!)  There were other guests in the house (kind of a micro-hostel, shared common space vibe) but everyone had privacy. Vincent and Melissa greeted me when I arrived, we chatted while the house was tidied up, and I couldn’t have felt more welcome. 

The house is basically a museum—immaculately clean, cozy, and every corner tastefully designed.  On the inside, there’s charm—exposed brick walls, hardwood floors, beautiful furniture, comfortable beds, and renovated bathrooms and kitchen.  Outside, there’s a cute little backyard and the house is situated in the perfect location, right near Santa Fe Drive and a 5 minute walk from the light rail station.  Seriously, if you don’t consider this place you’re doing yourself a disservice—this is the AirBnB experience you hope for."

57192,8884899,111776747,2016-11-01,10003896,Qi,Arianne is a warm and friendly host and she responded to my message in a timely manner most of the time. Her apartment is cozy and clean and I like the most of part of it. But I need to point out that the wifi was really unreliable as it's shared with the whole building. I think the host should put a special note on this as wifi is quite important for some of the travelers. There's no way to enjoy Netflix or Hulu or even YouTube despite Arianne's warm note. 
77233,12365447,275325176,2018-06-10,19195207,Jari,Patrick's place is exactly as pictured & described.  We had a  great stay & enjoyed many of his recommendations in the very handy guidebook in the home.  I would absolutely stay here again!

They had every essential we needed and even included a guide to Denver which was extremely helpful being that it was our first time there. Just a couple doors down from a really good Latin-Asian restaurant called Chuey Fu's and within walking distance to a fun 90s theme bar called Monkey Bar. Also just a quick Uber ride away from everything we wanted to do & see. (tons of breweries, Denver Biscuit Company, Bacon Social House, Voodoo donuts, the zoo) Overall we had a great stay & will definitely be staying here the next time we visit Denver!"

Check-in instructions were sent to me in an overwhelming 10 text messages. Most important instruction is to make sure you dont lock yourself out because you surely can if you lock the door wrong. Host stays on property in the basement, but wasnt there most the time.  Responsive host through text/call. Had a good time. Thanks!"

The bedroom area is adorably styled with a salt lamp and diffuser that added a unique touch- pillows and bed also super comfortable. The kitchen area was definitely an unfinished basement and could be a little tidier in my opinion.

80376,12933173,495794414,2019-07-26,5149350,Joe,"Beautiful home in the best neighborhood in Denver (in our opinion at least). We stayed a full month here - some highlights: relaxing on the front porch; walking 5-10 minutes to the downtown West Highland area with amazing restaurants and shops; hanging out in the den downstairs. The neighborhood is quiet and extremely safe, plus you’re just 10 minutes from downtown and within 30 minutes of tons of amazing hikes in the mountains! On top of that, Kate is an amazing and welcoming host, and she can recommend anything you’re looking for in the area! We’d highly recommend this home to anyone visiting Denver."

137116,19293155,215981439,2017-12-02,36053421,Lindsay,This place was simply amazing. Recently updated and the fact that the place was keyless was one less thing to worry about while traveling. Allan was a great host with great amenities. The coffee provided was simply tasty. He easily accommodated us for early check in and late check out. His place was in uptown which made it easy to walk to the bars/restaurants in the uptown area. It was also an easy walk to the downtown and Cap Hill area. His response time was great and aided us in anyway he could. Would definitely stay here again.

Leanne was out of town but Dave was more than helpful getting us checked in and offering advice on places to eat, etc.  The shower on a scale of 1-10 is an 11!  Bed is very comfortable.  We stayed plenty warm with the fireplace.  There is a small fridge but no microwave.  There are games for children to play.  This fit what we needed perfectly.  I would stay here again.  "
41513,6730800,147063729,2017-04-24,125962308,Deborah,"Really adorable property. Terrific location with great places to eat nearby. The kitchen is not well stocked as far as utensils and dishes. (2 coffee mugs for a property that accommodates 4 people) 
Night parking is a pain. Make no mistake, even late at night you're lucky to find a spot even two blocks out. 
The photos don't really show it but the stairs are treacherous!!!
Great shower/small bathroom. 
Not good for elderly guests. 
Couldn't get wifi. "

His incredible communication and detailed information on the home made it an immensely smooth stay. This home was incredibly clean and spacious with your choice of 2 living room areas and 2 separate bed rooms. He even left some snacks (bananas and breakfast bars) and coffee/tea for us. There was no issue with parking as there was a spot right by the private entrance. Overall very impressed with our stay.

63205,9604653,127482309,2017-01-18,48957715,Rachel,"This was the best airbnb experience I've had thus far, hands down! My housing arrangements for my last day in Denver fell through, and fortunately I was able to book KayJay's space same day. He was very communicative and gracious. The private room and bathroom were perfect, comfortable, and spotless. As a solo female traveler, I also felt very safe and respected by the host. Also, I had been snowboarding for 3 days, so crashing at KayJay's and having access to Netflix and a comfortable bed was just perfect--exactly what I needed. This location is very close to many restaurants close by. All good remarks, no complaints! I'd definitely recommend to friends. "

Jennifer & Giovanni were excellent hosts and even allowed us to drop our luggage there before check-in and after check-out. The cottage was so cozy and they had lots of little touches like coffee, coffee creamer, little snacks a full length mirror (and if you smoke, everything you need).  It was an easy Uber/jaunt to downtown so it was definitely a great value as well. We will definitely be back!"

The location was great and parking wasn’t too bad “ I don’t parallel park often I got some good practice.” The space looks exactly like the pictures. All appliances were spotless, the kitchen fully stock with things needed to cook. This was my first trip alone. Matt checked on things with me throughout my stay to make sure I was having great time and to address any concerns. Neighbors and the community was super friendly, beautiful neighborhood, and safe area. I love the food and dispensary options. Matt and his property management team responded to my concerns and corrected them immediately better respond than than I’ve experienced at most hotels. I would definitely stay again."

Krista is very warm and welcoming and was so happy to break down/describe neighborhoods in Denver so I could help decide on where I wanted to rent a place. Her home is decorated nicely, very clean, has a little workout/yoga room (it was great to be able to go for a run on the treadmill!) and the room I stayed in was perfect for what I needed. The bed was extremely comfortable and I loved the bathroom and huge shower. I absolutely recommend staying here. Thank you Krista!  "

The location was great for access to my conference at the Renaissance Hotel on Quebec--a straight shot down 38th St. The neighborhood seemed safe, even arriving there late every night of my stay. The household, too, felt safe and secure, and the room was quiet, with plenty of fresh air and a convenient fan for warm evenings. A pretty room, a comfy bed. Very nice!"

197606,26130792,491717824,2019-07-20,12710083,Simon,"Don't miss out on this gem.  The individual bedrooms/bathrooms within a shared house complex is an ideal Air BnB experience - like staying at a hotel but with the comforts of home.  There is a huge emphasis here on communal facilities - coffee machine, breakfast, stocked bar - while ensuring that you have the privacy of your own bedroom and bathroom facilities.  No shortage of great eating venues, bars, etc on your doorstep.  Hosts were a pleasure to deal with and were very responsive to requests by our big group of guests.  Laundry facilities available.  On-site manager was very friendly and helpful.  Highly recommended if you are staying in Denver for 1 night or a week."

There's a heater for when it gets chilly (recommended at night) and internet tv when you're not out and about. Their is place is in the Five Points neighborhood, which is a fantastic neighborhood that's walking distance to downtown, numerous breweries, and endless restaurants. There's also a light rail stop and a Safeway just a couple blocks away. Overall, it was a great experience that made visiting Denver feel like home. Thanks Beth and Jim!"

The only things you need to bring is yourself and your luggage. Everything else is in the apartment

By far one of the best places I have stayed at."

Capitol Hill neighborhood is very central and close to a lot of interesting places in Denver. I walked to most places while I was in the city. The 1UP bar which is 2 blocks down from Todd and Will’s place was my favorite place to hangout, get drinks and play arcade games. 
There is no dedicated parking but street parking is available and easy to find in the neighborhood. 
The interior of the space is beautiful and there is an amazing outdoor seating area.
Will and Todd even left a plate of homemade cookies for us."

Our private bedroom, bathroom and tv room were clean and beautifully decorated. The whole apartment was wonderful!! She helped us set up the air mattress and even put the bedding on while we were out!

It was close to everything we were visiting and we would love to stay here again! Thank you Maura!"

You have no idea what sort of home you’re going to walk into. After a long flight and a endless Lyft ride you arrive at Shelleys place and immediately you feel at home. You realize that your expectations have not only been met but exceeded. You are welcomed to a warm private area which has all the comfort of home.... and snacks to boot. 
I cannot stress enough how much Shelley deserves and truly surpasses her rating. She is responsive, knowledgeable, kind and just a really nice person. Everything was amazing and we were thoroughly impressed with the location and comfort of Shelleys place. Did I mention the bonus dog Stella! She’s a kind sweet ol lady who welcomes  your presence as well as your rubs and scratches. Thank you for everything and for creating a great environment for an amazing memory for me and Ivai!"

You do have to take a few steps on to the deck to get into the main house to use the bathroom, but it is no big deal. We stayed for 5 nights and did just fine with the space we had. Beth had bagels and coffee for us every morning and provided us with some tips for the area. Her children and pets are very friendly as well! Would recommend for any traveler who does not need much space and is willing to walk a little bit to get downtown. Overall, great stay!"

They have a mini fridge and microwave, along with an entire binder of eats, bars, 420, etc. LITERALLY everything you need to know about the area. The bed is pretty uncomfortable, but not the worst, just bring your special pillow and slide the mattress topper they provide on there and you'll be just fine. Overall, I will definitely be back and stay with Mark & Dan again. It was perfect!"

Kevin was very easy to get in touch with, actually texting me a couple days out how to get the keys, what time the cleaning people would be there & if I needed to get into the cottage earlier that day.  He also kept me informed as to gardeners being there and garbage disposal.  Lovely little property."

The apartment is very clean and comfortable, a place that I would certainly recommend to friends. The bicycles are a real perk! I jumped on one the day I arrived and cycled to grab food and hit a grocery store - both within a 10 minute ride. I really enjoyed my time in Denver and coming ""home"" to this place each evening made it that much better. I recommend Tom's place to all those traveling to the area. Next time I visit Denver this place will be at the top of my list."

217209,29606917,482597730,2019-07-06,91093536,Jordan,"Tracey's place was a great value for our quick stay in Denver! Street parking is always spotty (literally), but we had no issues finding open, nearby spots to the place. Check-in was easy, and there were several nice touches scattered throughout the place. There were hailstorms in the area during the first night, and we were content to stay inside and watch a show on Netflix on the smart TV in the den.

The bed does make a decent bit of noise, but the mattress and bedding is really comfortable. The only complaint is the ceiling height, which is expected in a basement level. If you do plan on staying, watch your head!

For the rate, amount of space, and location, you'll find it hard to beat the stay at Tracey's place."
144440,20215458,329751841,2018-09-29,22380744,David,"Joe's place is super close to the City Park. They were kind enough to have breakfast food, drinks, and snacks available as well as some Colorado hospitality that put this place at the top of the charts."

49718,7919653,84171286,2016-07-05,25311414,Maggie,"The photos of the Denver Victorian caught my eye for a weekend away with friends - it seemed too good to be true. When we arrived the house exceeded all expectations, it is even more beautiful in person. We all loved the Victorian detail with modern touches, it was fun noticing new things each day we were there! There is plenty of living space, the house is fully stocked with anything you might need (including a gym, swim spa and sauna!) and the bedrooms and bathrooms are comfortable and spacious. Staying in Colleen's home was simply a privelage. 

The immediate surrounding neighborhood was not very appealing but we found the city to be quite walkable...10 mins on foot would bring you to a park or a bunch of restaurants and bars. 

Colleen is a gracious host. She was extremely accommodating and communicative. 

Book the Victorian for a very special Denver experience!"

Location was also great and walking distance to a few restaurants. It was close enough to highway 70 which made our commute to a lot of the attractions so much faster. The house was also not too far from downtown Denver. 

If I had the chance to stay here again, I’d do it all over again! My boyfriend and I definitely would have prefer the amenities of this Airbnb over a hotel for our anniversary! Absolutely lovely!"

Location can't be beat, only a couple blocks from Union station which made it super  easy to get to/from the airport and you can walk to tons of fun bars/ restaurants. She gave us super detailed instructions on how to check in ect. and communication was perfect. The place itself is beautiful, I actually think it looks even better in person than the pictures and the fully stocked kitchen was much appreciated. I would definitely come back to this place next time I'm in Denver! "

19761,3410364,27436809,2015-03-04,19183714,Chris,"Honestly I have nothing bad to say at all. The place and neighborhood is a great place to stay if you want to see the night life on Colfax. Not mention you are literally a 4-10 dollar Uber/Lyft downtown. Every part of the city seems accessible in Allison's pad. Not only was she super accommodating but I felt impressed that even though she was skiing in the mountains the whole time she stayed there, she answered every call and I almost felt as if she was there. Usually I have constructive criticism about most things, but honestly the stay here was perfect. I could not of asked for a better 5 days in Denver. Thank you so much1"

This was our first time here and Javier's location was perfect for us; near all the spots we wanted to explore. Javier was very helpful and responsive and the process of check in/out was a breeze. The house had all the amenities we needed. We will definitely stay here again if we go back to Denver.

158842,21435378,285089480,2018-07-02,147563140,Kim,We loved our stay at Matt’s home in the trendy RiNo neighborhood. It was very clean and nicely decorated with soft sheets and comfy furniture. We enjoyed sitting outside on the front porch and in the private back yard in the perfect Denver summer weather.  There are so many hip bars and delicious restaurants only a very short Uber ride (or little longer walk) away. Matt was very quick to reply to any questions we had and very helpful.  We highly recommend this home!

The art and culture of Denver was all within walking distance as well as the conference centre so we rarely used our car. The fridge had lots of foods for our use as well as a basket of  goodies like wine and tasty snacks, all healthy and organic which were much appreciated. There were also plenty of toiletries.We had a lovely stay here."
68741,10500808,265929267,2018-05-18,181856691,Shane,"Great, small, and cozy place to stay for a couple days. Not even half a mile from a recreational dispensary, several restaurants, and gas stations. The backyard is small but cozy and private. The kitchen has enough of the utensils required for most cooking needs (we recommend you use the big pan and cook everything at once).  10/10 would do again!"
714,592,413513,2011-08-01,1510,John,"Jill is a very nice lady and a terrific host.  She has a lot of local knowledge which travellers from out of town will benefit from if they stay with her.  She has hosted over 100 guests, which speaks for itself.  Highly recommended if you're coming to Denver."

29814,4574082,229057273,2018-01-21,47140173,Anne,"This ranch is absolutely lovely and cozy beyond words! The gourmet kitchen came with not only every cooking implement you could possibly need, but ample spices, condiments and snacks. For parents with kids at the ERC, this location is just a ten minute walk, so we saved our uber dollars for things like going to REI or 16 street mall, about 10 minutes by car. We have stayed in many air Bnb places in the past....Sheila gets the prize for the very best!"

The best part of my experience is the host.  Nancy is squared away and went through some gymnastic routine to ensure I was taken care of when I dropped the ball.  I had some issues with my card and she quickly caught it and offered immediate support.  She’s offers a genuine personality, patience and is exceptionally flexible.  I will definitely revisit going forward."

This was my first time using Airbnb and I was a little weary about the whole process but Trace was quick to message me back about any questions I had which alleviated much of my anxiety. Check in was easy peasy; Trace gave crystal clear instructions on how to get into the building. The building, by the way, is one of the coolest/most beautiful buildings I have ever seen. It is insanely secure which is AWESOME! It's nice to feel safe in your lodgings when you're visiting a new city for the first time. The condo itself was so beautiful and had the most amazing views of the mountains. It felt like my home away from home and it made my trip THAT much better. We will definitely try to stay with Trace again on our next trip to Denver!"

Easy access to some great breakfast (Website hidden by Airbnb) was cold so hot coffee is essential......the kitchen amenities provided are exceptional. We really appreciated the good supply of coffee.  Unfortunately the offer of eggs from their chickens was not available during our visit. My wife did not find the mattress very comfortable, so upgrade is needed, but we did appreciate the skylights while sleeping (really cool).  Very comfortable stay, and we will definitely stay again when in the area. Thank you."

Although I never met Mimi in person, she was quick to respond to my texts and help out when I had questions.  There was delicious french press coffee left for us, as well as sparkling water, Denver guidebooks, and local ""where to go"" suggestions.  Everything was extremely clean, and the bed was incredibly comfortable.  Whatever you do, make sure you go to ""Jelly"" for breakfast- it's just down the street and has doughnuts to die for!  Overall, a wonderful experience for a long weekend getaway!  "

This was my first time staying at a place where the homeowner and/or other folks are staying there at the same time. So it was a little odd at first walking into someone's home. But the instructions to get to the rental space were really clear. And the room and bathroom is very private. It's  super cozy and cute space. The bed is comfy! We had everything we needed. It was perfect.

11850,1594161,167079910,2017-07-05,62704683,Cullen,"I am pleased to say that we are actually repeat customers of Brian and Tarryn!  Last year, my wife (Ashia) and I...plus our 2-year-old (almost 3) son, Carl spent a laid back, pleasant week at this lovely home.  Brian and Tarryn have two young children so I knew that we would be in friendly territory.  This time, we were traveling with close relatives and their 16-month-old son.  I was a little nervous this time because of all the moving parts but they set my mind at ease.  Again, we had a laid back, relaxing stay.  Tarryn, for her part, made sure that the apartment was fully stocked with juices, milk, bottles of water, etc. She even left toys behind for the kiddos (Carl LOVED the green recycling truck!) to play with.  But wait, there's more!  Tarryn let us borrow a small memory-foam mattress for Carl because the other bedroom was being used by the other couple.   I don't think that I could possibly undersell the warm, friendly environment that Brian and Tarryn have created.  If you're a couple traveling to Denver with young kids, I highly recommend giving them a chance.  You will not be disappointed!"

Really close to the heart of the city with cool restaurants and bars nearby. Parking is free for 2 hours a day on streets surrounding the building between 8 - 6PM and then free overnight. Place is small like described it's an efficiency apartment, there's a small standard bed in the corner of the bedroom/living room and a pull out couch.

The place itself is super clean, and has just about every small touch you could imagine, including chargers of all size and shape on the work desk.

It was incredibly clean when we arrived. The kitchen has wonderful new appliances and he has a nice grill. We enjoyed making dinner there. The best part was probably the hot tub out back! Great back porch. I liked the neighborhood. It was really conveniently close to many parts of Denver. The house was quiet and the beds comfortable. Made for great sleep. He has a great speaker system to listen to music and has cable and all the video streaming services that we enjoyed on a rainy day. I would recommend this place to anyone.

I traveled throughout a major portion of the area from Ft. Collins to Colorado Springs and it was easy to get to and from Emily’s place.  I was surprised by the abundant parking and the privacy.  

This space was tastefully furnished and, as I mentioned before, very clean.  The kitchen had everything you need for a longer stay.  I like to prepare my own food and this was the perfect solution.

Tarryn and Brian are excellent hosts. One note, and it is mentioned in their description, you will hear the pitter-patter of little feet, both human and doggie. It didn’t bother us in the least, but something to think about if you’re a late sleeper."

Alex was very responsive and helped us figure out a glitch in our reservation.  My son and daughter-in-law stayed there as well, and had their dog.  The yard was great for Luna and the home was very beautiful.  We had a few bridesmaid come on the morning of the wedding to get ready there and every single one commented on the beautiful home!  Close to where we had the rehearsal dinner the night before (Trattoria Stella - on 32nd Ave - amazing Italian food!!)  Overall, a great stay!"
53525,8444190,240712158,2018-03-05,165432885,Brandi,"This place is great, has so much charm and attention to detail. Clean and accommodating. We put the huge porch to good use every night drinking wine and listening to music , even though it was a bit cold at night being early March, nothing a big blanket couldn't fix. Friendly neighbors and in a nice neighborhood, never felt unsafe at anytime walking around the area. We walked to Luciles Creole Cafe for brunch on Saturday.  Do yourself a favor and go there.  Their biscuits are insanely good as well as everything else. Lots of shopping and nightlife and great food in just a short distance. Would absolutely recommend"

Being tucked away just a bit from downtown, this is a phenomenal deal for anyone with a personal vehicle, or if you are traveling with a bigger family. 
Definitely recommend this house for anyone!"
135882,19116550,455477239,2019-05-19,247493868,Megan,"Vanessa and Niko’s space was great! Close to downtown, easy get in and out of and very clean. The footsteps heard from upstairs were loud in the mornings, but not too bad. Overall, great price and a great place to stay when in Denver!"

The bed was very comfortable. Hassle free check in/out. I just needed a room to leave my bags during the day and lay my head at night while I explored Denver and this was perfect. DON’T MISS OUT ON THE MERCURY CAFE! It’s on the recommendations list In your room"
129603,18331882,278741693,2018-06-18,129173571,Jeremy,Had a awesome stay. Very high end amenities and space. Paul was very friendly and welcoming. This will now be our to go spot to stay when In Denver..

123004,17331962,535140261,2019-09-23,137085587,Helynn,"This is a true basement space, you can hear walking, dishes going in the microwave, and even conversations. Despite quiet hours from 10pm-7am, one night we were unable to get to sleep until midnight due to a dinner party being held upstairs.

It would’ve been a 5 star review had that not been a problem. 

Great amenities, coffee, wine, shampoo, lots of pillows to choose from. It was awesome being able to settle into this beautiful space, just wish it hadn’t been so loud. 

The dogs paws weren’t a problem for us."

The home provided plenty of space for the group and we were able to spend time both indoors and outdoors and enjoyed both areas! Erik and Kristen were prompt with any and all communications I had beforehand and check in was very easy.

Property was located less than a mile from the college and convenient to wonderful local neighborhoods and downtown Denver. Suite was clean, bed comfortable, suite private and quiet neighborhood. Dogs were a bit loud our first morning but after meeting them (5) proved to be the sweetest! Hope to have a chance to meet Annette on one of our next trips back."

201395,26639298,347735457,2018-11-11,2855081,Heather,"Annabelle + Christian's place was as described and more. The room had everything I needed and the bed was comfy. Having a private bath was really nice and convenient and extra touches like hairdryer in the bathroom and charger on the night stand were great. The setup for check-in was nice & easy. The location was walking distance to 2-3 bus lines and about an $8-9 Uber from downtown at night. I recommend the RTD app & day transit pass for getting to & from airport, exploring downtown, RiNO, other areas. The area was residential and quiet but had restaurants and local cafes & bars in walking distance. I would recommend Annabelle + Christian's place and stay again."
10720,1223612,32687874,2015-05-20,30003047,Simon,Cynthia was very sweet. She was very available and easy to communicate with. She is well informed about what to do around and will give you all the tips you need around a cafe or a tea.

Tons of great bars and restaurants within walking distance and even more within a 10 minute drive.  The place was clean and very welcoming.  I would totally stay here again if I went back to Denver, which after visiting I definitely would like to."

166231,22064284,254048173,2018-04-15,140446697,Zach,The house was perfect for our group of 16 guys. Very spacious inside with many bedrooms + beds that allowed everyone to sleep comfortably. Michael was very responsive to any questions and accommodated a very early check in. I can't imagine another house being better than this one for larger groups. It truly was perfect and made our time in Denver that much more enjoyable.
58144,9009513,70743245,2016-04-20,66964328,Miori,"Katie's place was just as described, but even better.  She added so many thoughtful touches to make my stay so enjoyable.  It was the perfect spot to relax after attending a conference with 8500 people all day.  Her home was a 10 minute drive to the Convention Center.  It's such a lovely neighborhood, and fun to explore if you are an old-house lover like me.  I know where I will stay next time I need a spot in Denver!"

It was nice for our trip with a 14 month old- toys, books, baby gate, pack n play were all available for use. There's room for improvement on some of the thoughtful touches I've seen at other places I've stayed, as well as general appearance/cleanliness. But great for the price and met expectations based on pics and description."
214302,29186188,477657176,2019-06-28,37242161,Ben,Very close to downtown. Had to set up last minute. No problems. Looks to be up and coming area too.

148492,20692793,506589617,2019-08-10,7466636,Hanan,"It wasn’t what I expected. Came for a vacation got a user manual (not so friendly) how to use the bathroom. If you fail to comply with, you will be penalize. Read description thoroughly before paying."
159426,21486523,468524753,2019-06-12,66577967,Susan,"I spent a week in Jim’s tiny house, and it was perfect for my stay, everything was very clean and comfortable, I loved that there was outside space with chairs to sit. Check in was super easy. The location is very good for the bars and eateries in the RiNo area of Denver, and Jim gave some great recommendations. I walked along Larimer street to Union station and the 16th Street Mall, it took about 40 minutes, but the 38th/Blake station is just a short walk from the house, and it is on the airport/downtown line. I would definitely stay if I visit Denver again.  Sue, Plymouth, England."

221239,30564223,420454508,2019-03-06,236177156,Morgan,"This was a great, cozy place to stay! Beth offered really nice recommendations and the area was in perfect reach to everything we wanted to see. The bed was very comfortable and warm and all the blankets and pillows were great, although the floor got a little cold without socks (which is to be expected considering it was barely 20 degrees f during our stay) The amenities were also great and we could easily park right outside. The only thing was at night you could hear some strange noises- nothing too bothersome. Overall it was perfect for a nice vacation in Denver."
215680,29359310,472939413,2019-06-20,53428028,Audrey,Sarah was a great host and has a great space! She responded quickly with any questions I had and made our stay great. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!

59627,9154399,92274749,2016-08-08,25565615,Scott,"The loft was just as expected. Upon entering, found that Suzi had left custom notes about places to eat, where to get coffee, and things to do. On top of that, she left a nice basket of snacks and offered anything in her fridge. To top all that off, besides the place being fantastic, she had no issue about a late checkout to accommodate a later flight home."
229696,32662157,472872930,2019-06-20,2699053,Kirk & Abi,"Abi's place is fantastic, clean, bright, inviting, great for co workers traveling together as its like having two separate wings with a shared kitchen, entry & living room. The pool was so nice after a long day, and the folks at the front desk were helpful. Whole Foods is across the street, and you can order Amazon in advance and have it held in one of the lockers.
I will be back, Abi was quick to respond and the location was perfect!"
78512,12685709,528797680,2019-09-13,25012164,Adam,"The location of this place is amazing. Right in the heart of a great neighborhood with tons of options for going out within easy walking distance. Overall, the place itself is great. Very clean and check in/out was a breeze. The view from the rooftop is awesome - a perfect place to sit and read with coffee in the morning. One note - the mattress on the sleeper sofa is awful - almost unbearable to sleep on. That might only be an issue if you've got more than 8 people, as the 3 other beds were comfortable and the air mattress was fine too. We were overall very happy with the stay and would book again in the future."
116813,16601681,206097944,2017-10-23,21124289,Patricia,Sara is warm and charming. Her home is out of a Denver storybook and her lovely dog Bella is the perfect addition to a great experience. The floor is completely private and the bed is the perfect place to crash after a day of exploring the city.

155245,21139434,294910478,2018-07-22,110204668,Jason,"This is a great place to stay.  It's near a lot of things to do and not far from downtown.  Off street parking here is a life saver.  There is a garage to park your car in, so you don't have to worry about driving around forever to find a spot to park on the street.  The washer and dryer being available to use is also a big plus. The place was nice and clean and as described by the host. Would definitely recommend!"
6685,769437,8378068,2013-10-28,9143927,Sue,"We had a great stay!  The room and house are very comfortable, Simone and Joel are very welcoming, helpful, and interesting, and Simone really does make the best granola.  The neighborhood is quiet but within walking distance of a lively part of town. "

79493,12864305,322616164,2018-09-13,5744692,Annie,"Here is a home located in a quiet, upscale neighborhood surrounded by really cute homes. With Washington Park, abundant cafes and shopping within walking distance, the location could not be better. The home itself is well appointed and spotless! I especially loved the exposed brickwork in the bathroom. Would highly recommend staying here!"
210529,28393012,556094636,2019-10-28,181478474,Kyle,This place is fantastic all around and the hosts were always willing to help us out or provide a good local recommendation. We loved the aesthetic of the apartment and the nearby Zuni brewery is a fun spot to have a casual drink. 10/10 would definitely Airbnb here again.
19215,3150813,306578130,2018-08-12,14583292,Sahar,"What a find! Really nice spot for groups: the pictures do not do the place justice! Very modern space and fire pits outside. Within 1 mile of main strip with bars/ restaurants, within 3 miles from city center. Everything is within a 10 minute walk from the house. Mark (and his manager, Alex) was an amazing host: super responsive to inquiries leading up to our stay, ensured we had everything we needed. I would highly recommend staying at this property for a fun time in Denver!"
236182,34570890,560135352,2019-11-05,276693326,Adrienne,"This was a cute, little place. 

There were some issues like a live and dead wasp problem. I killed a total of six. At one point, there was one crawling on my knee (yes, I was terrified). The TV was loud at 6 a.m. one morning, and there was some loud talking at night.

The host was nice, communicative and would respond quickly."

A bit disappointed they weren't expecting us and we had to wait outside for an hour until it was cleaned to be let in. The son that was home was very nice and did a great job cleaning, bed was comfy and there were oatmeal and apples if we wanted them. Despite it not being ready for us upon arrival it was still a good experience. "

Her rooms are upstairs and she has everything you need up there.  The view from her front porch is just amazing and that’s not the only spot with great views.  Tobi herself was super held up and swearing any questions we had and did everything she could to make our stay wonderful. The location itself is great and I 100% recommend staying here.

This was our first experience with Airbnb and it could not have gone better. Mick was very welcoming, easy to contact, and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was everything it could be. 

My familiarity with Denver was limited so the comprehensive manual provided by our hosts filled with suggestions and tips was a godsend. Every place we tried was amazing. The neighborhood is extremely close to the light rail or an easy walk to a plethora of places and felt very safe.

The amount of detail to make our stay so perfect was impressive. Beers/drinks in the fridge, tons of snacks, instructions for the tv, toiletries, a Keurig, robes, and even Crossfit classes! My husband and I can't stop gushing to our friends about how much fun we had!"

It took 3 hours, lots of supplies & a LOT of patience to complete. Also, 2.5 Weeks into the stay, a few mice invite themselves to a whole in the wall behind the stove.

The host did communicate well but the lack of action after those issues arose was very disappointing!"

Susan was very nice and helpful.

128104,18177763,298810757,2018-07-29,129126864,Erin,"We had a great stay at Lindsey & Freddy’s place. The neighborhood seems like it’s being rebuilt, but it is very close to downtown- just a quick Uber ride away. Lots to do in the area. We checked out a lot of breweries and local eats. Highly recommend Biker Jim’s hot dogs. 

We weren’t at the place too much, but it was great for us. The only downfall as others have mentioned is that the air conditioning doesn’t really reach the bedrooms. There are 2 fans in the back bedroom but it is still warm in their. 
"
50845,8071897,355328611,2018-12-03,62930881,Leigh,Great location.  It’s a downstairs unit with private entrance. Everything was clean and easy to find. Erica and Brianna are great communicators and all of the instructions are easy to follow. Street parking is easy if you have a car.

230179,32812933,452135006,2019-05-12,32058082,Rose,"I could not recommend this space enough. My mom and I were in town for a concert at the Pepsi Center and needed two bedrooms for a few nights while we explored the city. The location is perfect, very close to I-25 if you are adventuring outside of the city yet, very walkable within the city. If walking isn't your thing, ride share and public transit are available and affordable. The check-in/check-out process was very easy, we were provided a code to get into the front door and keys were provided for our coming and going. The door locks itself after leaving so we were able to leave the keys when we checked-out. When we arrive the space was bright and inviting, light meditation music was playing and the space smelled lightly of essential oil. Very welcoming. Brenda and Tyler provided a binder full of great information about this area and things to do if needed. Everything was clean, towels provided as well as a coffee/tea bar, and mini fridge. There was also a package of mini bagels and some jam/cream cheese in the fridge for our use. We were able to meet Brenda the morning we departed, she is a lovely host and very willing to provide her guests with any information they may need to make their trip better. I would definitely stay again when next in Denver."

152457,21013413,294142234,2018-07-21,198443882,Kathryn,Jourdan's place was perfect for our needs!  It was in a fantastic location; anywhere that we couldn't walk to was easily (and inexpensively) accessible by Lyft/Uber/Curb.   The keypad entry was a nice feature - no need to mess with extra keys while coming and going - and the AC in the bedroom was a lifesaver during the 90+ degree days.

The bathroom and kitchen were very clean. The location was ok. Within 10 minutes of everything, but I wouldn't exactly consider the neighborhood walkable. Overall I would stay here again."

The 2 minute walk to the lake is spectacular at any time of the day. With it only being around a 12 minute ride to downtown you get the new age suburban feel, and the city rush is only a short drive away.  The space itself is roomy and has a homelike feel to it. The bed is like a cloud and the warm shower make it tough to want to leave on cold mornings. Yes, there is minor noise but if you have children or siblings it reminds you of home. The outside space is great for catching some sun or having a cup of coffee and enjoying the natural air. Laura is a top tier host with excellent response time and knowledgeable on any questions we had during our stay. Would 100% stay here again!"

132496,18753893,551866886,2019-10-20,295000661,Alex,This was a great house for our guys trip to Denver.  Very welcoming and great set up.  The home was very clean and there were great amenities that the host was gracious enough to provide.
163033,21803491,288412225,2018-07-09,129058091,Jason & Lindsay,"Underwhelmed is the best way to describe our stay.  
We had planned to spend a good portion of time in the game room,  but found out upon arrival that it was closed for construction; we were not notified about this before our stay so it took us by surprise and changed our schedule. 
Breakfast was listed as an amenity, but what was actually offered was one bag of tea and black coffee; this is not breakfast to anyone in my family. 
The apartment felt under-decorated/sterile and could really use a table to eat at."
204923,27419666,529364835,2019-09-14,29832163,Michelle,"I had an excellent experience staying at John’s Airbnb and would highly recommend staying there! The apt is  clean & very inviting. It was nice hanging out in his large, beautifully manicured fenced in yard while enjoying a glass of wine. The space itself would be plenty of room for 2 couples; the bedrooms and living areas were very spacious. John was easy to communicate with and made sure we felt right at home. I wish we had more time to borrow the bikes, what a nice touch! Thanks John!"
96591,14486645,258697142,2018-04-29,175551844,Gabriela,"100% recommend this place, Mehdi has always the best attitude towards his guests, he will make you feel like family, he will go out of his way to make you feel comfortable, his house is always sparkling clean, and the rooms are so peaceful."

It offers privacy in a nice Denver neighborhood. It's within walking distance of some good restaurants with easy access to the interstate. Host was very communicative."
55334,8686305,85521479,2016-07-11,23658782,Katherine,"Billy is an excellent communicator. He sent a welcome letter with all the details about Stapleton Brownstone. He made sure I arrived safely and felt welcome to make myself at home. Billy went out of his way to help me find local fun events to enjoy over the weekend. He also was kind enough to loan me a screwdriver to fix my suitcase. 

The guest bedroom is comfortable and relaxing and has a great view of Central Park. It was great to have use of the remainder of the house, especially the observation deck on the third floor. 


Stapleton Brownstone is in a lovely walking neighborhood in a newly developed area of Denver. Central Park is right across the street and is a perfect place to enjoy the great outdoors. I was able to use public transportation and Uber to get around the area easily.

If you are looking for a lovely, clean, conveniently located home away from home, Stapleton Brownstone is for you. "

204129,27271600,333682843,2018-10-07,118098613,Courtney,"My spouse and I had a wonderful visit! The directions to the bungalow were very clear. The neighborhood was safe and close enough to downtown for about a $10 uber ride, but far enough away to avoid the hustle and bustle of downtown. 

The bungalow was enough space for two people. The commons area would have been perfect for an evening beer but it was a little too chilly during our stay to be outside. Everything was clean! 

We both wanted to spend majority of our time out sight seeing. So this was a perfect location for us. We throughly enjoyed it! 

The response to any time we had any questions or concerns were very quick!"

My husband and I stayed here for a week and Candace was very helpful and accommodating. The place itself is a perfect spot for a couple to stay if they are wanting to exploring Denver whether on foot, bike, or car. The place itself was clean and well put together. We felt as if we were at our own place. We will definitely be back again! "
7833,852934,75008660,2016-05-18,43349893,Timothy,Tom is an amazing host the place is very well furnished and hospitable. 10 out of 10 he made us fee very comfortable and is very friendly.

79433,12864305,191488396,2017-09-07,84765755,Juan,Perfect place for a nice quiet stay. Not to far from restaurants and shops.
239299,35971684,556078217,2019-10-28,61522263,Angela,"Wow!  This place was a lifesaver flying late into DIA into a snow storm and ice.  So close to the airport, very convenient, quiet and safe neighborhood.  I had not stayed in a shared home before and was wondering how private and safe it was and was very impressed.  My door had a secure lock and code and there were cameras in the common areas.  They provided nice touches as well such as extra toiletries and lots of clean towels.  I will definitely come back when I need a place to crash before flying in and out of DIA!"
81193,12990416,100314823,2016-09-08,71558129,Leah,"Susan and her family were great hosts - very friendly and kind. The location was ideal for me - within walking distance to DU, in a nice neighborhood. She has two sweet cats. Check-in and out was a breeze and Susan is very available via text."

An easy uber journey, drive or walk to the centre of the city and the house itself is beautiful. A large, spacious kitchen. Very comfortable bedrooms and a wonderful open living and dining area. Great hosts and great house!"

51559,8248031,82540879,2016-06-28,39289786,Rachel,"The location was wonderful and the space was clean and easily accessible. We appreciated the extra touches including recommendations for coffee joints and restaurants. However, if you are a light sleeper this may not be the best pace to stay. Because this is a older home as downstairs guests we could hear almost everything making it challenging to sleep. "
229597,32636273,557690685,2019-11-01,7661020,Lauren,"Loved staying here! The staff were so great and made my stay extra nice. Checked in with me to make sure everything was going well and we’re quick to respond when I had questions. 
Space was perfect , walkable to downtown and can’t wait to come back."

3329,364585,28168859,2015-03-19,27433472,Elizabeth,"We had a wonderful experience at Nicholas' town home. The house comfortably fit all six of us and was very nice. The listing is accurate. The rooftop patio has a great view of the sunrise and sunset. This place would be especially great for a calmer group as it is in close proximity to other houses. The kitchen had everything we would have expected. The rest of the house had plenty of sheets, towels, etc. Overall, we really enjoyed our time here. The location is also a bonus. We spent the first part of our trip in downtown Denver, about ten minutes away, and would have spent our entire time in Washington Park if we had to do it over again."
168206,22336069,241587088,2018-03-09,74817876,Sara,The place was perfect for our intimate friend reunion! The place had enough space to get ready with three people and not feel over crowded. The location was close to all the best bars and clubs in Denver. We will definitely stay again if we come back!

28791,4339474,32362569,2015-05-17,5923611,Alex,The apartment was the perfect size and location for our visit! It is located in a nice residential area and the check-in process was easy. We never met Holly but everything went perfect and all her emails were nice. I would stay here again.

25140,4014983,193762133,2017-09-14,16399200,Mimi,"We had a wonderful stay at Brad and Jenny's adorable carriage house. It was immaculate and had everything we could possibly need, including snacks, fresh fruit, coffee, and baked goods.  
  They were welcoming and friendly and an added bonus was their beautiful standard poodle who we were able to meet. The backyard is a little oasis with a fountain, flowers, and plenty of birds and squirrels. Having use of the bikes was a very nice bonus. An easy Uber ride to anywhere in Denver. 
 A perfect spot to stay if visiting Denver!"

The house was older and fit my needs for the price, but the location was perfect!! Right across from a nice park, & only a couple miles from mile high, coors field, and downtown!
 I would return!"
217796,29684773,441331445,2019-04-21,81939927,Ariel,"Dans place was great! He was very nice and accommodating! Place was super clean and close to everything. Within walking distance to a few restaurants, and about 15 min drive to downtown. I would definitely stay here again!"
226906,31989746,426324049,2019-03-20,161355770,Wing Yan (Winnie),"It’s a little quiet place like 10ish minutes from downtown Denver. The location is great because there are some restaurants within walking distance. Once you checked in, you just need codes to unlock the door, its pretty simple. The whole apartment itself is clean and cute, floorboard is a little squeaky but that’s expected since it’s a pretty old house. The room itself is homey, The bed itself is comfy for me personally but there are some lints/fuzz from the grey blanket that will stick to your clothings but it was not a big problem for me since i can just shake it off. I love the little touches that Chris has for the kitchen: coffee, tea, breakfast snacks, etc. The only mini complain is that there’s a neighbor dog (i believe) that barks at like 7am or early morning every morning i was there so i got woken up by that, but he will stop barking after 5-10ish minutes so again, not the biggest problem for me. With that being said, thanks for hosting us Chris! I really enjoyed my stay and definitely will be back for it when i visit Denver again!"
133229,18811589,238737490,2018-02-26,158496497,Sean,Marlene is awesome! Very attentive and gracious. This is a must stay at this quaint and comfortable place!
106753,15631740,446490007,2019-05-01,45312228,Priscilla,"Great location, super close to all the breweries. We had a great time at Allison's place it was very spacious and check in was a breeze. The only issue we had was that there didn't seem to be enough blankets for all of us. Unfortunately, my friends who slept on the pull out couch didn't have enough bedding, they pretty much just piled on a bunch of throw blankets. Other than that, great place to stay!"
25078,4014983,54393262,2015-11-19,40898209,Devon,"Our experience was perfect: from the rental bikes to the gluten free snacks provided, Jenny could not have been more accommodating. The location was perfect and the carriage house is so nice and clean. This is definitely a great choice for anybody looking for a relaxing stay in
Denver, Colorado. "
177951,23395457,255201660,2018-04-19,89517784,Marcus,Awesome spot. Sits in a great part of town in Denver. Will certainly be back if we need a place to stay.
163981,21835788,469471965,2019-06-14,9518141,Virginia,"Zac and Lisa’s Place was a great place for a family vacation. Lots of space to spread out and enjoy the “home time” and centrally located close to the train and highways to get out of town or in town to enjoy and see the sites. 
The house had absolutely every we needed to make our stay quite comfortable and relaxing. The outdoor space was especially nice. 
And best ... Zac and Lisa were most accommodating. When questions came up they were so quick to respond and accommodate. Would highly recommend their place for extended vacations with the family and would certainly stay at their place again."
70859,11139532,550892730,2019-10-19,146243453,Rebecca,This place is amazing! Hands down the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at. The hosts were very responsive and accommodating.

69427,10927966,480859146,2019-07-03,136767435,Ben,"This was my first time ever staying in a Hostel, and Hostel Fish exceeded my expectations. Everything was clean, the staff were very hospitable, and the venue was very stylish. I never felt unsafe or in fear that my belongings were going to be stolen. I would recommend any single male or female stay here when staying in Denver."
232272,33448646,559152100,2019-11-03,53696726,Jason,"Great loft in a trendy part of town. Walking distance to great food, brews, and coffee."

Carrie provided very thorough communications, including a good warning about Denver traffic that may well have saved us from missing our flight! :)

We would happily stay here again!"

924,31503,352543,2011-07-04,743759,Pau,"Rick and Sheldon have a really great place. They maintained it really well and I would say the Highland Park Guesthouse is better than many hotels out there. They use only the best materials -Grohe and Brizo for faucets, Breville for coffeemaker, Kitchenaid for microwave, Bodum for tea warming, etc. Other than that, the place is very spacious and electric outlets are situated in the most convenient places. 

Also, they do our beds everyday, clean the restroom, throw the trash, etc. We were really amazed with how they folded the bedsheets! 

Oh I almost forgot, Rick and Sheldon provided us with laundry soap for the new LG super washer and dryer. 

Parking is free!! Thank goodness! Parking in Denver can get too costly.

Given all that, the place is located very near downtown Denver. It's also 
just half an hour to Boulder so they really have great location too.

If we were to visit Colorado again, we'll definitely check in here!"
36532,5956309,48832324,2015-09-28,3682766,Arkar,Chill place and really clean! Street parking was plenty. Alex was really responsive and friendly. Thanks for the great stay!

The main room was decorated in all of her artwork and there was a record player to use. The bathroom has a very hot shower which helps when it’s cold outside and the kitchen has everything you would need minus a sink and oven. 
Amazing place to stay."
150144,20902989,263325737,2018-05-11,2504309,Elizabeth,"Alma's place is quiet and peaceful, clean, beautiful. Located close enough to get to anything in Denver, but far enough away from busy areas that you can relax. She clearly puts a lot of thought and effort into hosting guests and making sure they're comfortable. Super comfy bed, and the workspace with standing desk was a lifesaver. Looking forward to staying again in the future!"

PERFECT location close to highways and downtown Denver/stadiums, comfortable beds/environment, sparkling clean everything, and immaculate/updated kitchen. Sherry was super responsive and kind, offered great recommendations. We had no issues with our stay but it is comforting to know she would respond very quickly if we did need anything! Would definitely stay here again when returning to Denver. "

Located 10-15 min away from downtown Denver and right on the Green Mile. There’s literally a dispensary in your backyard and a restaurant called The Post where highly recognized chef Guy Fiery featured the restaurant on his show Diners, Drive-In’s and Dives. (I was not expecting that; so good!) Justin was very helpful and nice. 5 stars!"

Her house is in a very nice neighborhood of Denver, close to downtown where there are plenty of places to eat and drink.  She's a gracious hostess with a very friendly pet dog.  I especially liked the fact that her home is in a very artsy part of Denver.  The room itself was clean and spacious.  Check in and check out was also hassle free.  In terms of value, Andrea's place can't be beat!"

185052,24180313,490463643,2019-07-18,103224735,Jordyn,"Loved staying here! It was awesome for the price and location! You can book online for a cheaper price at Ember hostel, that is what the front desk told me when I needed to extend my stay. Had some communication breakdown and I came home to some local popcorn and a note on my bed from the staff. It was a great restart. It was a great experience, solo traveling as a 20 something gal I was nervous but I felt super safe there."

Cal and Dave were super-friendly and welcoming and had lots of recommendations.  It was my first time to Denver and I wanted to just get a taste of the city. In a short walk to downtown and around the area, I feel like I saw a nice diverse slice."

The bed was amazingly comfortable and the space was tastefully decorated, felt like I was in an IKEA ad :) there are tons of books available to read and they provided snacks and quick breakfasts from Trader Joe’s. The cereal bars definitely came in handy for our afternoon hikes. They also had 4 large bottles of filtered water available to fill your water bottle before you head out. Overall a great stay and I would not hesitate to book again if the occasion arises!"

His place is super clean and in a great location with proximity to plenty of breweries, Red Rocks shuttle pickup,  and easy bike ride to whatever you were looking to do. Highly recommend his spot if you need a place to stay in Denver."

244109,38801708,566546641,2019-11-19,99247037,Gabby,"Great location. A couple minor hiccups like not having any instructions on how to check in and had to ask about checkin the day of around 12pm to get any info. Upstairs has dogs which were constantly barking however we notified the owner and they quickly handled it - we didn’t hear them the rest of the time. Stayed for 3 nights. Bed was comfy enough for the time there. The ceilings were low but not too low- I’m 5’9 and boyfriend 5’11, and we could walk around fine. You don’t have any control over the hearing and air but it definitely feels like it’s own private basement apartment. They had coffee and a mini fridge."

He is very knowledgeable about his neighborhood (restaurants, cafes, and pubs) and the greater Denver area (museums, festivals, parks). We were from out-of-state and Channan steered us in the right direction to get where we needed to go. His house is stylish yet cozy and the neighborhood is in a charming historic area. Walking distances to good local eateries."

There were 4 of us and the air bed worked great (our parents were in the room). Cynthia had some snacks for us, which was helpful since we didn't have time to pick up anything.  The jacuzzi was set a bit too cool for our taste in the winter. "

21338,3479122,145737166,2017-04-19,4009439,Andrew,One of the most unique layouts I've seen among dozens of AirBnB stays. Perfect location if you're planning to attend a Rockies game. Wish I had more time to sit outside and enjoy the courtyard!
215046,29283226,472448034,2019-06-19,9788722,Shannon,Tonyas  place is amazing close to everything but quiet enough to be extremely relaxing. I’d recommend it to anyone staying in Denver.

125327,17623780,345960739,2018-11-06,54491176,Kathryn,"Danielle’s place was everything we expected and more. We were very pleased with all the amenities (coffee, tea, coffee creamers, beers, etc) and with how close everything was to the AirBnB. We never paid more than $10 for our Ubers downtown, and we took the RTD Light Rail to the airport for $9 (20-minute ride). We rented a car to drive to the mountains, and all the attractions and hikes we visited were around an hour to an hour and a half away. Denver is such an incredible place, and we’ll definitely be back & would love to spend more time at Danielle’s. Highly recommend!"
223991,31289444,534580372,2019-09-22,53055693,Danielle,Great place. Perfect for a group of 10+. Extra sheets and towels for the pullout beds were labeled in bins. Each bed was provided with towels and wash clothes that our group loved. The front porch swing and hot tub were awesome. We really had a great time !!!

The neighborhood was so safe and nice and I loved the keyless entry. The apartment was so beautifully decorated with really wonderful touches. I even found a curling iron and straightener in the bathroom.  Amazing! The decor is lovely and the bed was so comfortable. I’ve been traveling the world for 4 months and this is the best Airbnb experience I’ve had in the continental USA. Thank you so much, Allan!!!!!"
2604,98014,89269438,2016-07-27,4615786,Rushikesh,"Jim is a great host, taking care of all the details.  He is extremely welcoming and makes you feel very comfortable in his house, which is a masterpiece, having restored it himself. 

Being extremely close to downtown, it is great place to live, if you need quick access to the business district."

91747,13815789,542628987,2019-10-06,90998111,Bethany,"Beautiful,  clean space. Sleeping spaces as described - 2 bedrooms with queen beds and bathroom. Go through first bedroom to get to 2nd bedroom and then the bathroom. Sleeping accommodations for 5th/6th person were not super comfy - the couch was adequate, the 2 futons not so much for an adult. No sink in the kitchen area, but there is a water dispenser and access to laundry room sink. It was a little loud one night of the stay, but otherwise very quiet.  Beautiful back yard space to relax in. Overall, enjoyed the space and would stay there again."
168304,22336069,361097586,2018-12-22,15937946,Monica,Excellent space and location. It was clean and comfortable. Will definitely love to stay again when in the area.

38581,6333040,51532941,2015-10-21,10433640,Camille,"We chose to stay at Mick's for the first leg of our honeymoon in Denver. We are SO lucky to have snagged this place... it was better than any hotel we could have gotten. The carriage house was immaculately clean and decorated so cute! There was champagne on ice for our arrival, so thoughtful. We also loved the halloween candy, haha!

There is a great green binder inside which gives you so much helpful info about the area.. definitely used their brunch and dinner recs!

The neighborhood the carriage house is located in is awesome... walking distance to bars, restaurants, and coffee shops. Just a block away from the light rail which was super convenient. 

Our hosts were superb. Not intrusive on us at all, we just went about our business and they theirs. Very responsive to any needs and are able to accommodate many requests. We were going on a tour of the US Mint and were afraid that we wouldn't be able to check out on time and Mick reassured us that it would be no problem for late check out.

Overall, great experience with this place. Definitely will book again if back in Denver area."
95153,14325896,366510008,2019-01-02,181577342,Natalie,Liked the location of this place! Stairs up to the bedroom/bathroom are steep and you need to be careful. The house was more of a place to sleep for us and a little bare on the other portions I am used to. Good place for the price and location though and I will still look into staying here again
143351,20022219,309709437,2018-08-18,27860318,Prateek,"Juan is a gem of a person and indeed a super host. I stayed at Queen Irene B&B for about a month and my stay was enjoyable and most comfortable to say the least. The place was spotless and was very well maintained himself by Juan. During the month, apart from what I would call my home, I never felt away from my family. Juan made my stay truly memorable. We spoke endless number of hours and his travel experiences and amazing stories were something to cherish. His zeal and enthusiasm towards life was inspiritional and I had lots to learn from him. I would highly recommend staying at Queen Irene B&B and spending some time with Juan, the ultimate host. Thank you Juan for all the lovely hospitality and memorable stay."

Would highly recommend!"
164704,21867798,222795677,2017-12-30,82540287,Marci And Brian,"This suite is in a great old hotel building on Colfax. There are walkable clubs and concert venues nearby. The flip side to that is that the room is right off the street and the windows are old. You definitely hear street noise. I think in the warmer months this would be a great place to sit on the little veranda and sip coffee and watch the busy go by. The kitchen is cute and useful though there was coffee left with no filters, a form of torture. The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed the decor as well as the awesome bathroom and tub."
97819,14728998,117073488,2016-12-04,72385893,Valentina,We had a wonderful experience! The room was beautiful! Steven was very accommodating and included lots of great suggestions of places to visit in Denver! Would recommend staying here to everyone!

We (a couple) weren't there much as we had a wedding to attend, but Jessica was very accommodating and we'd recommend this stay for anyone looking in the area!  Convenient location for this part of town and we would like to stay with her again!"

It was an easy walk to downtown Denver and still very easy to get to the towns around Denver. They're recommendations in the neighborhood led us to the best Cuban sandwich we've ever had!

Safeway is 2-blocks away also so you can grab some food to use in the fully stocked kitchen. Just look out for the heater in the bedroom as it gets a little hot at night, but great to use to heat up the bathroom if you turn it that way before a shower!"

I would just like to warn others that his dog is huge and sheds like crazy. I loved the pup, but if you are not a dog person and not okay with the mess they make, id avoid hugh's place. Otherwise, it was great."

I loved being able to get up and walk greenway park. It is very close to the University of Colorado Anshutz Medical Campus, and the airport. I appreciated how quickly Cheryl responded to me and how clear all her directions were. I hope to go back to Denver and the Carriage House soon!"

Super close walk to the light rail and a short/cheap Uber trip to anywhere else that you don’t want to walk. The room and bathroom were perfect for my husband and I. The private patio out back was beautiful.

162382,21756198,452265524,2019-05-12,19309304,Hailey,"Staying with Jason and Liz was nice because they accepted us last minute, had a clean cozy bedroom for us, and were about a $17 Lyft trip from the airport. The area wouldn’t be ideal for someone who doesn’t have a rental car or didn’t budget for a lot of Lyfts but it is great for the end of a vacation or a work trip. Their home is huge and Jason is very open to his guests when it comes to sharing his space (plates, toiletries, patio, etc). The bed was comfy and their home is in a fairly quiet neighborhood. The cats were sweet and their home didn’t smell like the kitties at all. We had our own key and felt very welcomed and appreciated their easy-going vibe. Thanks Liz and Jason! The smoke shed was cool too!"
120204,17071293,162861386,2017-06-22,99155211,Philip,Exactly as advertised! Get the chance to sit on the balcony for some spectacular sunsets.

The kitchen is well-equipped and large enough for most cooking exploits. The location is quiet and has a cute neighborhood feel, with several restaurants just a short walk away. There's ample street parking."

My boyfriend & I recently stayed with Megan & David and it was amazing. We were only a few blocks away from a cute strip of bars, shops and restaurants. Megan & David provides awesome tips for going out at night and for brunch which we found super helpful. And the space was just what we needed for a nice weekend stay in Denver. I would highly recommend it!"

(We rented a car) We drove to the mountains a couple of times and the highways are a very short distance drive from his home. Ryan has everything you need to have a relaxing stay. We stopped at Trader Joe’s before checking in and stocked up on a few snacks and breakfast items. He has 2 French press’s and pour over coffee maker! His home has everything you need to make yourself a nice meal as well! Check in was extremely easy and parking was available all times of day. Very clean, very well decorated and has all you need to make your stay comfortable. Ryan emailed us a day before with a full list of places drink coffee, eats ranging from low to high prices, and things to do. We ate at a handful of his recommendations and were not disappointed! This was our first time in Denver and Ryan’s home and list of recommendations made our trip amazing! We will definitely be back! Thank you Ryan for your wonderful hospitality;)"

My room was clean and bright, and nicely decorated, and the bed was comfortable.

The price was reasonable. 

Overall, I was delighted.

I would definitely recommend this home away from home! "

There is a small space heater that almost did the job. And it's pretty far away from the city, better for visitors who have a car. Otherwise $15 uber minimum to get to another neighborhood. "

It was super spacious and had everything we needed for our week in Cherry Creek. The location is very convenient and we were able to walk to the mall and Cherry Creek North, as well as the grocery store for all of our needs. The check in process was a breeze and Angela was so awesome to schedule a late check out for us. "

Her place is comfortable and spacious, and locates at a friendly neighborhood and not far from the CBD. The Nature and Science Museum is only about 2 miles away. 
Jill responded my message very fast and provided detailed information about how to get to her place. 
The overall experience was beyond expectation. I'll be her place whenever I'm in Denver."

I do suggest using (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps instead of Waze, because Waze took us to the wrong address even though the same address was put in. The bed was the most comfortable thing my boyfriend and I have ever slept on. Definitely recommend a stay here!"

Hot shower, lots of blankets and towels, big couch and tv for lounging. It's in the basement, so not much sunlight, but not a big deal if you're spending your time out and about anyway. Tonya and Jeff were great hosts!"
157945,21343580,266913517,2018-05-20,59232712,Casey,Great little basement apartment with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom.  It's not too far from things and uber/lyft can get you if you don't want to drive. Zana is very responsive and a great host!

62846,9523086,191466126,2017-09-07,144337250,Phil,"Staying with Eric was a terrific experience.  The prior submitted positive reviews were all very accurate, and our stay was as expected.  We were mostly out and about during our trip, so we only ran into Erick once or twice. Although our meetings were brief, he was extremely welcoming and easy going.  

The location of the apartment was terrific, just a short walk away from numerous great bars and restaurants and a short uber ride away from the heart of downtown Denver.  While we did not make the walk into the city, we very easily could have.  Parking was an absolute breeze during our entire stay, as there are plenty of open spots in the area.  The check in process was also a breeze, as Eric works around your needs.  The apartment itself was pleasantly comfortable, cozy, and clean.  Additionally, as the prior reviews state, the bed was very comfy."

177312,23355811,463948550,2019-06-04,167785742,Laura,"Very disappointed!!! Show up to find crumbs on the couch, dog hair all over the linens, and the backyard oasis I was hoping for had dog hair, slobber, and poop all over the place.  We refused to even stay there.  

Alex agreed we would not have to pay for any nights that we did not use and then came back and said that I blew the issues out of proportion and said take it up with Airbnb.  Working through resolution center now not sure if I will get my money back but I would not stay in a place that has cleaning people that think it was acceptable for our first impression to walk into that mess!"

The location was super convenient to most areas of town. The place was very clean, comfortable and stylish (exactly as shown). We had an issue working the air which we mentioned and Chris came out to deal with it the same day and fixed it. Chris was super accommodating, helpful and nice! We loved the place so much and hope it's available next time we come to town!! We wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!! Five stars!! :)"

60607,9237825,268362154,2018-05-24,32762049,Alexia,"Nola's place was exactly what I was looking for, quiet, clean, equipped with the basics to make myself at home for a few days, fast Internet to get work done and close public transportation.  Bonuses were that I had access to the back yard and the location is in a safe and quaint old neighborhood.  If you have never been to Denver, check out the older areas.  The houses, some lovingly restored or kept and the great little restaurants, coffee shops, and businesses that have bought life back to these neighborhoods make for a great place to stay and explore.  Check out Nola's recommendations.
All was close via car or public transport.  Parking in front of the house was easy. I had to use grocery, car parts and book stores while there and found all within two miles.  Getting to the convention center took about 30 min via bus. Add 10min to your ETA since all busses seem to run late all the time. That said, the bus drivers are super friendly and customer service oriented.  The time they take to accommodate is probably why they are late.
Super stay and would recommend and come back!"

We loved the location which was a quick walk to Broadway where there were loads of restaurants and shops to choose from. The outdoor, green space was a plus along with the off-street parking. Although the street in which the home is located is quite busy, we never heard any traffic/noise. The home was supplied with paper towels, toilet paper, garbage bags, dish and laundry detergent, etc. which was so nice to not have to buy. We did have an issue with the toilet during our entire stay of which the owners were quick to respond to. I hope they can get that repaired before the next occupants arrive.  We enjoyed our stay!"

89643,13744375,201704320,2017-10-08,18197774,B T,"Overall, the unit was as advertised.  Our challenge was initially finding the unit due to what appears to be a long-term construction project completely blocking the entrance where unit is located on Cherry Creek.  We spent over 60 minutes looking for the unit, only finding it finding it after my husband walked to find the unit and then walked to find a cross street to direct me as I drove our three-year-old son who (Website hidden by Airbnb) 1:30am.  This did not feel safe for my husband, or for our family. Thankfully, we did not experience any challenges.  We suggested to Mark that he provide future guests with an address that directs one to the secondary street that allows one to easily access the unit.  Once we found the unit, it was comfortable and clean.  TV and Wifi worked well. We didn't use the oven/stove but assume it worked.  We had adequate towels.  The furniture was comfortable.  The only challenge, which we informed Mark of, was a slight stinch coming from the carpet near the TV.  It appears a past guest spilled something. It may not have been cleaned properly. A simple deep cleaning of the carpet would likely suffice. The location is ideal for the Denver area.  Mark also offered to extend our check-out due to our challenges finding the unit.  It was a nice gesture.  In general, Mark was very responsive to all communications.  We had a good stay.  Thanks, Mark."

We decided to do something different this vacation.  I am so glad we did.  The photos and descriptions were accurate.  Loved the vibe of this property and the location.  We didn't have to get in the car to go everywhere.  We enjoyed checking out the neighborhood and eating at a couple of local places.  Felt very safe.  One night my husband and I walked to one place for dinner and our teen daughters walked to another.  Also, easy access to the highway.  The next time we are in the Denver area, we would choose this space again."

Carrie also helped us find a parking spot in her garage after a last-minute decision to rent a car. That was very helpful and ended up saving us a lot of money.

Her place is very centrally located, within walking distance to almost anything you'd want to do downtown. The bed was very comfortable, and her view is spectacular. We would definitely stay here again."

Never got to meet Dennis - we used it just for one night as a place to crash at. The communication with him was easy and professional. Getting in and out was very easy. There was no window in guest room - but I had read about that before so it was not a surprise.  And shared bathroom, again read about that before.  Though both those things made the place very ""cozy"". But you are paying for location, location, location and a wonderful host.  Would definitely stay again when I come back."

Located in a nice neighborhood, but only had street parking which is limited, and was very noisy at night. We used Uber a few times and it was very affordable from this location. Elizabeth was very accommodating about check in and out times, and communicated well with us. She provided many nice personal touches to make us feel welcomed. Would recommend to anyone and would stay here again."
236624,34715139,563416583,2019-11-12,30443550,Sean,"The room, amenities and location were all exceptional. The guild did a great job to make us feel comfortable and at home during our stay in Denver. The unit is closely located to many popular spots in Denver that are a <15 min car ride away. The river walk immediately outside of the unit is also very scenic."

126739,18002228,456896798,2019-05-22,10837135,Anthony,"This is such a stylish, beautiful and comfortable place to stay. There’s parking, space to spread out, and so much more. This location is located in a fantastic neighborhood and close by so much to see and do. It snowed during our stay, so we didn’t explore much by foot, but having visited Denver before I can say this is a great place to be located if you want to travel by foot to lots of food, coffee and more. I can’t wait to book my next trip to Denver to stay here again!"
151612,20949319,199706292,2017-10-02,3769063,Ashley,"We stayed 3 nights in the upper guest apartment. It is newly renovated, clean, comfortable, and conveniently located. Nick met us on arriving and gave us a tour of the space & neighborhood tips. Food, shops, and breweries all in walking distance. We used the bikes for a quick spin around Cherry Creek. Great spot in Denver."

60419,9201317,265026173,2018-05-15,176066208,Nick,My flight was canceled & on the way home figured I’d just book a Airbnb as my friends flight left later that evening. After going thru I figured since Allison’s spot seemed close to downtown & I didn’t have to deal with the staff at the Maven again. (Another story). Seemed like her reviews were high so I did it. Perfect place to just unwind. The upstairs was decorated nicely & clean. I didn’t however spend anytime there. The bed was comfy & shower was clean. Pretty much all I needed. 7$ lyft to downtown also. I didn’t notice any TVs but I don’t watch much television so no real biggie for me. Overall the place is just how it’s described. Thanks Allison

17722,2599115,74304583,2016-05-14,18059949,Patrick,"House was nice and in a very nice neighborhood. The house is appointed very nicely and has plenty of room for six to eight people. We were a group of three, so space was not an issue. House was close to everything.   We rented a car and downtown was 20 mins away, there is a bunch of restaurants within ten minute drive. "

183864,24062073,267749417,2018-05-22,4902289,Shiloh,"The Cottage is stylish yet simple with all the amenities one might need. While it's a studio, it felt very spacious. Perfect for one or two people. The neighborhood is quiet and residential yet in a very good location for getting around Denver. It's half an hour from Boulder and 25 minutes to Red Rocks which was very convenient. There are also a couple of trendy neighborhoods around with restaurants shops  Etc . Josh was very responsive and I had a great stay."
127867,18153418,233017695,2018-02-07,44884139,Raymond,"Great value, no-fuss stay for an emergency last minute booking. The space was great and private, with an ideal location for those accessing downtown Denver. Would definitely recommend!"

68234,10426535,283379331,2018-06-29,94487200,Edward,"If your looking for a 420 location, than this is the area. The unit is about 8 miles or a $15-20 Uber ride to downtown.  We arrived a little before check in and took a walk to see what was close by. One block away on the opposite side of the street there was a good pizza joint and a bar. A couple of cold beers was a great start. Next door there was a Cannabis dispensary. It was perfect. We checked in and had everything we needed. There are many dispensaries within walking distance. The unit itself was clean and the neighborhood was quiet at night. The check out time was 10am, a little earlier than expected, but we went downtown and still enjoyed the day before heading out."
238545,35640219,512742854,2019-08-18,156376163,Taylor,This place has everything you need. We were very happy with our stay. The hosts were friendly and the space was clean and welcoming. Occasionally heard footsteps but the place was private and comfortable. Would come back! :)

I treated it as if it was own...thats how comfortable we were. We walked home from the stadium. Thats how close it is. Aside from that the roof top view is outstanding. I will miss that. Corbin responds immediately to questions. The place is quiet and cozy. Will definitely go back for the next game.

It was quaint and in a quiet neighborhood that was also in walking distance from Broadway, which was convenient for food/drinks. The bed is the best ever! The bathroom is gorgeous and the porch is great for evenings sits. We would definitely stay here again and advise you to stay with them. :) 
Thanks again!

17259,2441525,68388500,2016-04-04,63977,Debi,"We were extremely comfortable in Juan's bungalow.  We chose his place for the neighborhood (walking distance to our son's home) and were very pleased with the cleanliness and spaciousness of the home.  We were happy to host our grandchildren, ages 3 and 2 overnight and they did just fine.

The kitchen is spacious and updated.  We didn't cook at all, but I felt very comfortable doing so if needed.

There are long-term residents downstairs, and our only worry is that our noise might have disturbed them.

Thank you Juan, I""m pleased to refer your listing to more visiting family members."

13755,1911814,25376539,2015-01-13,7430969,Beth,"My husband, baby and I had an amazing stay at Suite Sunnyside. It felt like our own little apartment in a great area of Denver and was the perfect landing pad to explore the city.  Fantastically designed space and a splendid bed that is one step below a cloud.  Good restaurants within walking distance and Randall and Dana even brought down some toys for our little one.  We will definitely stay here again next time we're in the city!  Thanks guys!"

229224,32498162,510804352,2019-08-16,279155090,Matt,The place was very nicely decorated. I didn't remember reading that ot was attached to the owner's place but that didn't matter too much to us. The management team is very helpful and responsive. We didn't spend a lot of time in the air bnb because there is so much to do in the area around it.
23397,3760606,472970936,2019-06-20,45230754,John,"This is a wonderful place, in a good  location. I recommend breakfast at Universal, about a block and a-half away."

Easy walk for amenities and food, but also close enough to uber! Cori was an exceptional host and checked in on us to make sure we were doing ok, or needed anything! She went above and beyond!"
75750,12169927,348409638,2018-11-13,222632033,Blake,"Gabriel and Vanessa were very thoughtful and sincere hosts. They offered plenty of genuine, personal touches from start to finish and engaged appropriately without sacrificing our privacy. We actually enjoyed getting to meet Vanessa and her two daughters, but regrettably didn't get to meet Gabriel in person since we arrived late and our schedules didn't sync up. Both of them are humble, professional, and fun. Their apartment was fully-equipped, clean, and cozy and the bed was large and very comfortable. Kitchen and  bathroom were stylish and offered everything we needed. WiFi was a little spotty at times but it snowed while we were there. Also, just be mindful when using the oven, as the smoke detector is quick to pick up on the heat when the door is open (we learned this the hard way late one evening...oops!) Overall, would definitely recommend this place to others traveling to Denver who want to be close to all the action of LoDo (downtown), walking distance to plenty of local shops and retail stores, but also conveniently accessible to miles of reputable hiking trails and parks. Would definitely stay again in the future."

There are many good restaurants nearby and a market within walking distance. Place was immaculate and well thought out for Airbnb stays. Our host was very communicative and friendly. I can tell he really takes pride in the place. I would definitely stay here again!

Location was perfect for me - cozy house in a quiet residential neighborhood but close enough to get to all the hot spots easily. Room was small, but more than enough for a solo traveler.

The apartment had everything that we were looking for: comfort and that feeling of luxury.  We really enjoyed the memory foam bed and having cocktails on the balcony. The host left us a bottle of wine which was appreciated after a long flight.  The neighborhood is extremely walkable and family friendly, while still having some nightlife options.  This has been one of my favorite  airbnb stops!"

By its nature (basement) you can hear the family walking or talking at night. If you are not sensitive to that it gets five stars, if you are sensitive to a bit of noise from upstairs it gets four stars."

You are only a 15-20 minute walk from a light rail station (15 minutes to downtown) and definitely within walking distance of some great restaurants and coffee shops. Charlotte provides a great guide to the neighborhood upon your arrival, and all of the recommendations that we tried were excellent. Plus, her next door neighbors - and their puppy Scout - are very welcoming. Say hi if you happen to walk by when they are outside."

180730,23685442,542782263,2019-10-06,25502731,Denise,"Great value, off street parking, full size refridge with many things in it for cooking, cute little place"
75899,12186872,224617008,2018-01-03,820839,Stacy,"This is a great location, quite artsy and cutely appointed, and offering a lot of privacy. I especially appreciated the convenience of a key-pad entry, so we could check-in at our leisure. The price was right, too. I never actually met the hosts, but did communicate some over text. Communication/responsiveness could have been a bit more timely and proactive, but overall, we had a great stay. It's a cozy place. I recommend it!"
229487,32606610,505045083,2019-08-08,141150491,Hayley,"This place was so centrally located to everything we did and was clean and had everything we needed. The host was especially accommodating, and we had a ton of privacy. Would definitely stay here again."
184306,24083668,313647713,2018-08-25,15601810,Alex,"This is my second time staying here and it wasn’t quite as pleasant this time. It’s difficult to navigate to the Airbnb, which is through the owners yard, in the dark. The grass is long and the sprinklers were on sometimes, making it difficult to get there without getting wet. And, you do have to be careful of dog poop in the yard if it’s dark out. On the plus side, the dog is super sweet and the space is comfortable and modern."
3957,521072,425084017,2019-03-17,20510859,Justine,"Matt’s place was the perfect place for two. Great space, clean , good location being in the middle of town and close to wherever you need to be. I would definitely recommend"
147885,20624536,536966163,2019-09-27,18770936,Galen,This is a great place to stay with many things to do in the area. A quick walk will get you to everything you need. Be sure to do research on things todo in the area so you have a good game plan. The city can be a little confusing if you don’t do some planning. Great stay and great hospitality.
199645,26328157,453717051,2019-05-16,36013478,Rene,David’s home is beautiful and in a great location. All the amenities are excellent. David was quick to respond and offered up great suggestions on dining options nearby. Would recommend to anyone.

184020,24064731,277590392,2018-06-16,56956403,Courtney,"We really loved our stay at this Airbnb. It was very centrally located, there was literally a bus stop almost directly in front of the house. I also really loved the bed, so comfortable! I slept well every night. It was a very comfortable and cozy place to relax after walking the city all day. Would definitely recommend."

185330,24222389,271204750,2018-05-31,26639883,Steve & Anna,"What a comfortable carriage house. Deb was very quick to answer any questions, provided lots of snacks, privided a clean space, and we loved the proximity to Washington Park, Whole Foods, and a neighborhood coffee shop.  We will definitely stay again."

116021,16548314,488202710,2019-07-14,90696727,Eugene,"Stayed here two nights and loved it. Didn't really cook or spend much time there, but the place seemed to have everything one might need. The location was great, in the quiet and charming Congress Park neighborhood, just a couple of blocks from the Denver Botanic Gardens. Cherry Creek and Downtown easily accessible from this location, good parking, nearby mom and pop market, restaurants and coffee shop all about three blocks away on 12th Avenue. The unit itself is just so interesting: quirky and charming, with many interesting architectural details that made engaging with the space visually stimulating and fun. Tomas was easy to get a hold of, if needed. Normally I stay at a hotel in Cherry Creek when I visit Denver, but that hotel is closed for renovation. This presented a unique and affordable alternative, and I'm glad it was available to book ... full on laid back Colorado style ..."
99372,14842171,150686297,2017-05-08,69879389,David,"Our stay at Michele's house was great! She was extremely accommodating and gave excellent recommendations, including local events and places to see. Thanks so much!"

83502,13171401,140566803,2017-03-30,119181638,Dave,"Great experience.  Jon and Shelby are good hosts and most hospitable.  And, very understanding when we needed an extra night.  I would recommend.  "
224872,31514726,515971164,2019-08-23,27490397,Emmett,Hospitable and  convenient.  A bit of issues with the front lock (fellow guests had difficulty receiving access) but no big deal.
125072,17607361,401494676,2019-01-14,20870088,James,"Liz's place is comfortable, clean, and great for spending a few days in a great neighborhood in Denver. While the basement apartment is comfortable and cozy, I probably wouldn't want to stay for an extended trip (more than a week or so). It was well lit and always toasty warm, though very simple. You will hear Liz upstairs and voices also carry. I never felt like anyone upstairs was unreasonably loud, it's just that there's little to dampen the sound. We stayed over a weekend and while we could hear folks upstairs, it didn't go late into the night and wasn't unreasonable. Someone who goes to bed early and is a light sleeper might have a problem. The neighborhood is great: very walkable with lots of great restaurants as well as grocery stores, Walgreens, etc. In short, there's little to deter me from recommending the apartment, so long as you're looking for something simple and cozy."
111577,16087125,142915469,2017-04-09,27698861,Karen,"My daughter and I celebrated her 21st at Julie's place, what a great time. Julie greeted us right away and made sure we had everything we needed. Julie and her pup, Opal, were very friendly! The house was in the most perfect location, walk to anything. We enjoyed happy hour at First Draft Taproom and Kitchen, amazing Brussels sprouts! 
Julie's house was very clean and welcoming, a very relaxing place to stay. BTW, the bagel/cream cheese was a welcome surprise in the morning!!! I hope to be back again very soon!"
155413,21141369,435833967,2019-04-11,22971734,Ken,"Great location close to 32nd/Highland restaurants etc all within walking distance.  Even walked downtown a couple times - 30-40 minutes.  Quiet street, slept great!"
161967,21730063,286224309,2018-07-05,198199924,Ethan,"This is a nice place to stay and a good value for the price.  It has comfortable private rooms with locking keypads, as well as a nice entertainment area and kitchen.  Peter was a very friendly host and I would definitely stay at his place again."
235576,34361721,510216272,2019-08-15,49293744,Kari,Zaid and his wife have a nice clean room for guests. We stayed here on our return trip as well since it is so close to the airport. We would definitely stay here again!
16726,2267500,139460867,2017-03-25,66922597,Jeannie,What a lovely cottage in a great location! It was very convenient to walk around the block for excellent food. Street parking was easy. An excellent place to relax after a long day!
173794,22978126,301708282,2018-08-04,196628032,Hannah,The house was in a great spot! It was very easy to park there and felt super home-y inside.

188171,24575556,284616129,2018-07-01,122423680,Scott,"I had planned a 22 guy bachelor party to explore Denver, skydiving, white water rafting etc. It is hard to find a place that holds 22 guys but David’s place was perfect. Extremely affordable, very modern and new. Walking distance or short Uber rides to everything you need. He was extremely helpful up front, having patience while I tried to gather money from 20 guys. I highly recommend David’s place. "
2702,142683,497792,2011-09-03,909120,Chris,"My family and I stayed with Nancy on our recent stay in Denver for the American Chemical Society meeting. We were only a short cab trip from the convention center, and it was ideal staying only a block down from the city park. The house was clean and comfortable, even for our large family, and Nancy kindly made the yard and sandbox available for our kids to play in. This was a beautiful neighborhood and a great place to use as a 'base camp' for our week in Denver.  Highly recommend- thanks Nancy."
122595,17325994,460253871,2019-05-28,32450903,Kim,Great stay! The information provided prior to check-in was clear and thorough. Self check-in was easy. The room and home were exactly as described and very clean. The hosts were away for most of our stay but were friendly when we did meet them.

215129,29300648,512672274,2019-08-18,29036649,Keegan,"Lizz’s space was a perfect escape for a long weekend. A quiet, inviting neighborhood welcomes you to this nook that is situated ideally near some of Denver’s best spots for food or a drink. Lizz was responsive and inviting. Only wish we had more time there."
125575,17664945,139301554,2017-03-24,84720645,Tom,Randall was very welcoming and was a great host! The space was very cozy and well decorated. Randall offered to help and was willing to help whenever he could. The space was very private and relaxing with a direct outside entrance and relaxing back yard! I highly recommend!
107852,15766497,186870514,2017-08-25,123536505,Christopher,Jacob was a real friendly host. Really easy to communicate with and he'll even hang out for a bit! Right by the trains so getting around was easy.

233242,33704620,456446373,2019-05-21,40994309,Sonal,"Matt and his wife were a sweet couple. Matt was quick to reply to any questions we had about checking in. Overall, the interior of the house is modern and very well decorated, and we found street parking right in front of the house. Also, Denver is a quick drive west, but you might get stuck in rush hour traffic on the weekdays."
94723,14154970,146389410,2017-04-22,56101748,Matt,The house was perfect and Scott couldn't have been a better host.

183045,24016595,318851311,2018-09-04,139512069,Kaylee,"Our stay at HIlary's place was great! The location was perfect for us since our friend's place was only a few blocks away. The bed is super comfy with nice linens, which is always important to me. The mini fridge and kitchen sink were enough for our needs since we were not interested in cooking during our stay. When entering the basement apartment, the sidewalk entry way is very narrow, but we were able to bring our large cooler in that we were using for camping later in the week. The neighborhood has some streets that feel less safe for late night walking around, but overall, we had no issues. We were able to walk to RiNo for a beer and coffee which was a nice perk.  Hilary was super responsive and easy to chat with. The owners didn't bother us or try to chat us up, which, honestly, is my preference. Parking is on the street but there were always a ton of spots open. I would def stay here again or recommend it to others."
194484,25477727,482509526,2019-07-06,53728659,Ryan,Very nice accomodations in an extremely convenient location.  Available parking makes day trips (especially with children) a breeze.

92943,13910543,112916153,2016-11-08,70862402,Danice,"Janet is a very welcoming and thoughtful host. She was friendly made a good effort to make me feel comfort during the entirity of my stay. She is also knowledgeable and helpfully informative about the area.

The amenities were great: Space set aside personally for me to use in the kitchen, plenty of cabinet space in the bedroom to unpack my suitcase for a while, the availability of extra blankets as needed, laundry facilities, etc.

Janet's house and yard are nice and peacefull. Both the kitchen and patio are a nice place to have a meal or a cup of tea.  I appreciated having nature nearby in the garden and among the well-kept plants indoors. 

I stayed for a month while investigating employment opportunities to relocate to Denver from the east coast. I felt comfortable to go about my business on my own but also appreciated occasional friendly talks and company during my stay. The animals of the house were also well-behaved and friendly. 

Once oriented, the location is very convenient to get to if you are using the RTD light rail to get around the greater Denver area.  Denver University is about a 15-20 minute walk away and has a B-cycle station on campus. Janet also offered me the use of an extra bike to get around the local area.

The closest grocery store was a convenient 5-10 minute walk away, with other options further down the road. There are also some parks and gyms in the area.  If you want to get around without a car, the 40 bus route is also nearby and runs along Colorado Boulevard by shopping areas and up to Denver Museum of Nature & Science.

I recommend this AirBnb and would definitely be happy to stay again or say a friendly hello if I end up passing through the area again."

She made us feel so welcome. Great location, and definitely worth the value. I accidentally left a few items and she offered to return them should I provide the address. I offered to pay the freight and she refused, #DenverHospitality. If she would have us, I would definitely stay here again."

She has all the basic amenities you would need and was very accessible during our stay. Her place is in an awesome location right off Colfax and we didn't travel more than 2 miles to most of our local destinations. Super safe and quiet neighborhood. Plus she has an adorable Boston terrier pup. Thanks again for everything!!!"

If we needed to take a lyft we were very close to downtown and the ride was only a couple dollars. We got to use the roof to star gaze and enjoy a couple drinks. Thank you for accommodating to our needs and also providing the recommendations!!

The location is a short walk from the train station, and close to all of the fun parts of RiNo. The house is cozy, especially the wood stove & hot tub — perfect for an even of relaxation.

They offered us so many recommendations on things to do, places to go, and where to get great food! They gave us our privacy but made sure we knew they were available for any help. 

Billy took the time to ensure that we were comfortable and taken care of! 
I HIGHLY recommend staying here for anyone going to Colorado! I will definitely be back!"
235873,34474444,504374562,2019-08-07,156122628,Kirstin,"We were very happy with this rental! Everything was clean, the beds were comfortable and the area felt safe. The backyard was a great area to hang out and grill with our family. With it being as hot as it was in Denver during our stay, we really appreciated having air conditioning! While checking out Denver’s shopping areas, restaurants, parks and the zoo, we did not have to drive any more than about 15 minutes from this location. We had quick responses to questions from the renter. The private parking in the alley was a bit tight for an suv, so we ended up parking on the street in front which was fine. There was never any issue finding a close spot. The house is super cute, too!"

Be ready to climb stairs with your bags and luggage. We didn’t mind it. There are two doors to use to exit the Penthouse. One parking space too. The restaurant below has great food that you can eat in or order take out which is helpful. There is also a liquor store next door that sells orange juice, snacks, water, and adult beverages. Host is very communicative throughout stay. It is helpful to (Hidden by Airbnb) the area to see what the neighborhood looks like and other venues, bars or restaurants nearby. Lyft or Uber into the city or use public transportation. We didn’t rent a car and took the train from the airport into union station (30 min ride) and then take bus line 15 straight to the Penthouse or use Uber/Lyft for a few dollars. Very handy."

62770,9520316,534560343,2019-09-22,68945326,Kevin,Jennifer’s carriage house was perfect for our weekend in Denver. Everything was walkable or a short $7 Uber ride away. We would definitely stay again.
129472,18306843,425056213,2019-03-17,165144473,Brian,"This is in a great location. It is a 5-10 minute walk to the light rail, which is a direct trip to the airport. Everything was extremely clean.

His kindness and hospitality are apparent and his place just felt like home. The bed was so comfortable and we were both able to sleep well during our stay. He also includes these little notes/tips around his place that add just the perfect touch. We highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone.

His home gave us the option to find our way around either using city streets or interstates. The space is very inviting after a long day. John is full of tips and tricks to enjoy the city and quickly replied to our questions. You won’t be disappointed staying with him.

215772,29360234,545167490,2019-10-11,16586298,Alex,"We loved staying in South Pearl street on our most recent trip to Denver. The space was beautiful, we'd even go as far to say it was the best AirBnB we've ever stayed in. There were thoughtful touches, nice decor, the bathroom is excellent. We did have an unseasonably early snow while we were in town, but we were still able to walk around and see the area. Our favorite part was the local map on the wall. Thanks for such an awesome stay! We're lucky we found this little gem."
2591,98014,49533629,2015-10-04,665241,Nithin,"Jim was a fantastic host and took a lot of effort to make sure I was comfortable when I arrived. He was also very prompt and consistent in communicating and made my entire stay flow very smoothly. He gave me a tour of his beautiful house along with some history of the neighborhood and the city. My room had a very comfortable twin bed and everything from the room to the bathroom was very clean. He even encouraged me to use the rest of the house as I wished, which was great to get some work done. Again, I cannot emphasize enough how beautifully designed his house is. Added to my overall experience of Denver in general."

Jessica was quick to offer suggestions, hospitable, nurturing (my brother hurt himself and she helped tremendously), cleanly and all around a great hostess. She set the bar really high for my future AirB&B visits and I will look her up first on any future visits to Denver. 
The location was perfect because it was close enough to downtown but far enough away to have peace and quiet and w/ easy access to the major highways. I wish there was a sixth star to give the whole experience!"
232573,33530848,533504676,2019-09-21,81887140,Abbas,We had a great experience at the appartment. The location of the appartment was perfect for the conference that we had at the Gaylord Rockies Convention Centre.

location, Location, LOCATION!!!!  Derek's place is literally across the street and could NOT be more convenient for 2 people with tickets to Coor's field.  We were <10 minutes from the condo to our upper deck seats during a sold-out Dodgers/Rockies series.

The unit is perfect for a couple (nice queen sized bed) upstairs.  We didn't use the kitchen during this stay as there are plenty of good restaurants within walking distance.  

Derek is highly responsive by text and the unit was clean and tidy. I would definitely return for another baseball getaway when I'm in Denver."

The room was OK - there is very little natural light because it is a basement level room, and it was a little chilly. Her house, though, is warm and cozy, and she has a nice backyard patio. The room and house was very clean and having my own bathroom was a plus! I would definitely stay with Denise again."

If you have your own car/method of transport this is place is awesome!! However, if you are without a car, keep it mind that it is still a bit of a drive to the airport and to restaurants around the area (meaning potentially expensive ubers)."

The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean and the bed sheets and towels were very soft. I loved the added touch of multiple phone chargers by the bedside table, very convenient. I walked to the local coffee shop, Weathervane, near their house every morning for breakfast and coffee and it was a perfect way to start my days."
77885,12622842,82368990,2016-06-27,15081566,Juanita,"Manda was an excellent host and she even left a personal touch in my room that I will be adding for my own guests going forward!! She is actually the first host that I have been able to meet since the inception of my Airbnb experience and she was very kind, friendly and courteous.  

The space was exactly as listed and the renovations to the bathroom were simply lovely. I felt comfortable utilizing the kitchen areas and refrigerator as well and she even left little nick-knacks for us in the kitchen. 

The best part about the listing for my stay was that it was easily accessible to public transportation and allowed easy access to downtown and other areas- which were all in a 20- 25 minutes bus ride away. 

I also enjoyed the other guests that were staying there at the same time in another room. Manda even notified me that we would have additional guests prior to my arrival as well- which was not something that she had to do. 

In the event that I am in the Denver area again, I will definitely reach out to Manda again. "

It was a fairly last minute stay as our house is being remodeled and we found out the day before we would have to be out.  Anu was flexible and helpful and we had a great stay.  The location is a bit far out from the city center but is very close to public transportation and is walkable to the Stapleton area which has restaurants, bars, and a nice park.  For the price, the stay was great!"
161403,21684051,410153244,2019-02-09,159529468,Logan,I loved Elizabeth's place. It was so comfy and the location was perfect. Definitely a down to earth relaxed spot in a great neighborhood.

Ty's hospitality and communication was second to none! He was very helpful in getting us situated, after finding out that his place only had a window AC unit in lieu of central AC. If we ever come back to Denver again we will stay at Ty's place!!"

60353,9201317,202754315,2017-10-12,37848232,Amy,"Allison is a A++ host. Our room & bathroom were very clean, cozy and private. It was a perfect place to reenergize between our outdoor adventures. Allison is a cool girl with a lovely home located in a great neighborhood. Many great places are within walking distance or a short Lyft ride away. We had a fun time chatting with Allison and her roommate Johannes and would definitely stay here again."

Eric met me to walk through the house which was clean and beautiful and I loved that they had  a binder there with info and local restaurants  and things to go do. Excellent experience!

203598,27174706,345683867,2018-11-05,79144481,Hank,"So cute!! My boyfriend and I came here to Denver for our anniversary and we could not have picked a better place. Although the ceilings are small, we were both able to fit with only one minor head bonk. It is in such a great area too! Definitely a quick uber or even a walk to most things in downtown. We didn’t get a chance to meet our hosts but you can tell by their guest notebook how much they are able to connect with people and just be overall great hosts! Communication was on point and they were super helpful with any questions I had. I will definitely look for this home again next time we come!"
234817,34147762,476687246,2019-06-26,76818349,Felecia,"Anna was incredibly kind and responsive. I was in town for a family emergency, and she helped me get into the space early, which was very helpful. The basement apartment is clean and comfortable, and if you're traveling with several people, an amazing value (two good-sized bedrooms and a sofa bed). The neighborhood is peaceful, and I was able to walk to DU in under 20 minutes. 

Be advised that although there are windows in both bedrooms and the kitchenette, it is a bit scant on natural light. If you don't mind that, there are plenty of bright lights available in every room. This isn't a criticism, just an issue of preference. 

Coffee and sugar were thoughtfully provided, which means a lot to the coffee addict that I am, and the apartment door opens up to a quiet backyard space. It's great for DU visitors or anyone wanting a quiet, good-value stay in the area."
90946,13789731,135628842,2017-03-05,113078186,Betty,Great place! Super convinient & just what we were looking for!

142484,19893591,289612616,2018-07-12,64758041,Lance,"Nice little spot in a great neighborhood. Didn’t know much about Sunnyside before coming but it’s a ton of great little homes and has great restaurants (Bacon and El Jefe on Tuesdays) that are walkable from this place. Lee is super easy to check in with, the place was clean and is also very easy to get to downtown. Great spot for a few nights in Denver."

We had a late flight in and didn’t arrive at the house until 1am, but Andrew was accommodating and stayed up to make sure we got in alright. His house is in a great location; we had a car, so it only took about 15 mins to get to most of our destinations in the city!"

206041,27583000,502599158,2019-08-04,23894880,Brandon,"I saw the review saying no hot water, but I didn't see that before I booked lol. So as soon as I arrived I checked the water and we all had hot showers the whole 6 days. It definitely is spacious,  pillows are very soft, clean sheets,  restaurants alllll around, close to Gaylord and the airport, and keyless entry. Those were the pros. The cons, I saw hair on the floor in the half bathroom which disgusted me. The toilet holder fell off and woke up my whole family basically when it happened in the morning. Internet was very poor, a lot of buffering so I connected the tv to my hotspot. The second day, it did appear much faster. Communication, none. I asked him the first day, via Airbnb message, where are good restaurants.  I stayed 5 nights and I'm back in Maryland now, and still am waiting for that answer lol. I then decided to call him the next day, I left a voicemail. No call back. 2 days later I called and he sent a text saying he will call me back. No call back. I didnt try to contact him again. Also, I opened the drawer to use the tongs for cooking and oil/grease was all over them. If I'm paying $75 for a cleaning fee, the place should be spotless right?"
74202,11722154,254445270,2018-04-16,91379785,Chris,"The house was everything we wanted and more! AJ and Kat were incredibly accommodating. the location was perfect, everything we needed was within a 5 mile radius. the house was stocked with everything we needed, even with a few colder days then we expected. we couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay in during our first Denver trip. HIGHly recommended!"
160533,21608586,515330349,2019-08-22,3340276,Paul,Very clean unit with a nice view. There was definitely a strong chemical smell upon arrival which dissipated once we opened the sliding door. Amy is quick to respond to any questions.
195811,25770124,334335768,2018-10-08,126029954,Amy,We had a great stay at Ivan’s place. It was exactly as described and we had everything we needed. Ivan and Cole were very quick to respond to our messages.

104131,15330451,483489651,2019-07-07,246250674,Camille,We loved our stay at Tim's home.  The house itself is lovely and very clean.  We visited a lot of different spots around the Denver and surrounding areas and this location was perfectly situated.  When the intense rain caused an issue in the basement that then affected the water heater Tim was very quick to respond and  correct the issue.  Tim was also very accommodating and helpful overall!
125049,17607361,295972866,2018-07-24,142420947,Evan,"Great private space in a nice Denver hood. Very comfortable bed, clean sheets, and great community amenities to help you relax and enjoy the space. If you’re a dog lover, you’ll love the shared backyard with Liz’s dogs. Thanks for being a great host, Liz!"

Sandy her self was very personable and in the house you feel her energy or should I say her eye to detail. Location is very central, easy to travel and having Washington Park so close was a plus. We loved the decor and how Sandy makes this house feel warm and welcoming. We will definitely be back!"
42144,6883917,99701011,2016-09-05,55904878,Alison,"We had a great long weekend staying at Ryan and Gloria's place! It was close to downtown Denver which was nice! It was out first experience staying in someones home while they were there. However, it was a great experience because we still had our own private room and bathroom. If we are ever back in town we will look for Ryan and Gloria's place!"

The backyard and patio were a magnificent way to relax. Everything we wanted to get to was just a short drive away...amazing!"

234461,34019010,491846348,2019-07-20,111588670,Teryn,Mary went out of her way to make our stay really enjoyable. We were there during one of the hottest weeks so we were a little uncomfortable but there were a lot of fans in the apartment to help. She stocked us up with breakfast items (even gluten free items for one of us which was so nice) along with plenty of towels and toiletries. We really enjoyed hanging out with her puppy  and it was in a close location to all of the fun things Denver has to offer. The apartment was very private and we (hopefully) snuck in and out without bugging anyone. Thanks again Mary!
185410,24245200,295977497,2018-07-24,68316291,Sam,James has a beautifully updated carriage house just a 10-15min walk to restaurants on Colfax. Would definitely be happy to stay here again!

122511,17325994,249165945,2018-04-01,29713708,Kha'Azraa,"Keith and Cris offered such a beautiful and comfy home for us to stay during spring break. It was a very clean and easily accessible home . With all of their advice , adventure tips  about Denver and hospitality they improved our trip by more than half . I would recommend 10 out of 5 stars for anyone to be hosted by Keith . One of the best Airbnb’s I have ever been apart of , you won’t be disappointed."
36724,5956309,275772954,2018-06-11,41125139,Daniel,Alex's spot is in a great location and the room is great for one or more people! Really enjoyed staying there and would stay again!
185510,24245650,274234109,2018-06-08,38399717,Kurt,"Overall, a lovely home in a great location that we'd happily go back to you.

A couple things to note: the only bathroom on the second floor is the master bath, so the other bedroom on that floor needs to either share that or use the first-floor bathroom (along with the first-floor bedroom).  On the hottest days (it was over 90 most days we were there), the house would get a bit warm, but, again, we'd happily go back."
172604,22798737,551771616,2019-10-20,95321468,Nikki,"Great three story home near a lot of activities. Easy to get Lyft and the entry is a keypad, making it easy to enter. Pillows and blankets were very comfy! We would definitely stay here again."
47811,7663335,251834643,2018-04-08,7044059,John,"Solid place for my needs.  Some pros: it was located in Capitol Hill which was good for work stuff—near the cluster of downtown buildings for conferences and such.  It was also relatively close to South Pearl street area full of restaurants and bars (15 min drive max) and 15ish minutes away from RINO area, and the area itself had some cool restaurants and bars within walking distance. Another pro was having a dedicated parking spot since I rented a car and drove out to the mountains and it was nice to not have to search for street parking.  

Any cons? Not a huge issue but there were definitely folks smoking weed in the building on a regular basis. I don’t hate weed at all, and live and let live right? But it was definitely noticeable every time I walked into the building. 

Another “con” was that there were a few folks nearby that seemed homeless.  I also have no issue with homelessness or poverty, and I don’t equivocate poverty with danger or violence.  But I am sure some people wouldn’t be keen about this.  

Overall, I would strongly recommend this place if you wanted a central place to explore the city, and also wanted a dedicated parking spot you can use to hit the areas outside of Denver."
12254,1733052,16458393,2014-07-28,14793244,Barbara,I was very pleased with the quick response time to my questions prior to my arrival.  The guest space was very comfortable and accurately portrayed in the photos and description and was clean.  Little amenities provided throughout the space made us feel at home. Loved the ambiance of the basement suite . The house was convienient to lots of eating options.
122042,17251698,188217177,2017-08-28,65297020,Nathan,"It's a basement apartment, not a 5 star hotel. It's perfect for what it is, exactly what I was looking for in a weekend crash spot while I was attending a conference for work."
83978,13189674,184450739,2017-08-19,10924405,Mandi,"Leanne's place was nothing short of perfect! My boyfriend and I stayed for 2 days will vacationing in CO and we fell in love with her quaint home. She has everything you can possibly imagine to make our stay so comfortable and fun. She even had phone charges for both android and iPhone set up for convenient use. Thr location is perfect, short and cheap uber to so many bars and restaurants!My boyfriend and I loved it so much we want to live there! I'd give 10 stars if I could! Thanks again Leanne we will def stay with u next time we are in town!"
73774,11690656,479962749,2019-07-01,150728708,Carrie,"Cassie communicates quickly. The unit was clean. As the posting described, it is 420 friendly (it will smell like marijuana in the unit), there is a free roaming kitty (he will climb in the bed with you) and you are sharing the owner's home (you will hear and see them in the unit). If that is not your type of travel, then this unit is not for you. Otherwise, you will have a great experience! There are many things within walking distance and you can be downtown in less than 15 minutes."

100189,14962333,177435271,2017-08-02,58229783,Collin,"Sarsha's place is everything you need for a quick nights stay. It is a great location to popular restaurants and bars and was easy to check in and out of.  It was a bit smaller than I had imagined and the place was pretty hot inside (though there is an A/C unit that cools off the bedroom nicely). Overall, I'd recommend Sarsha's unit if you are looking for a clean and centrally located place to stay."

The location was great - a quiet residential neighborhood.  I will mention that we could hear the residents upstairs, so we made sure to be quiet if we got in late so that we didn't disturb them.  Although we were only there briefly, we had a very nice stay.  Would recommend."

There's a few nice coffee and breakfast places just blocks away. Being able to park out back was awesome. We met the second day and she was lovely.

That bus can get you to practically anyplace in the downtown that you would probably want to visit. If you are attending a convention, the center is 1 1/2 blocks away, and much nicer than staying in a hotel. "
45249,7359477,231338314,2018-01-31,165922462,Jonathan,"Really nice and cozy place, netflix and cable on the tv and a binder full of local restaurant menus. Can't beat the price and location."

I felt very welcome in her home. The space was fantastic-- a very large room and private bathroom with all the amenities. I was in town for a conference at the convention center, and was able to get there for $5 or less via Uber."

The apartment was very clean and comfortable (the bathroom is especially beautiful). Close enough to downtown to be convenient, far enough away to be peaceful. Tyler and his family were very nice and got back to us quickly with any questions or concerns we had. 10/10 would stay again."
137573,19387287,245313594,2018-03-21,31942766,Jared,"LaMark was a very kind dude. I definitely recommend his place. The house is updated nicely with a new kitchen, bath, and gleaming hardwood floors.

104462,15378908,258807904,2018-04-29,38172360,Katie,"This beautiful loft apartment fulfilled all of our needs to relax, escape and be in a foody area of Denver for a few rejuvenative days.  We walked everywhere but for a side car trip to Tattered Cover for books, and ate at Avanti and Old Major, which were gustatory highlights of our 4 days.  Her place is so lovely and thoughtful and steeped in history that we probably spent a large part of our waking time there just wandering around and speculating as to how the hay came in, where the horses were, who was in this space, etc.  Marianne provided all sorts of great amenities - coffee, snacks, dehydrated soup in case you got caught hungry at midnight, bathroom soaps/lotions/etc.  Marianne answered within MOMENTS when I texted her a question!  Altogether lovely.  We would go there again in a heartbeat.  Many thanks to our thoughtful hostess!"

160280,21593370,512923680,2019-08-18,161959192,Meredith,Decent location. Not as fancy as advertised. Shower is confusing - the 'hot' knob is on the cold. Easy check-in/out and walkable to a few good places.

I had a hard time  communicating with Mark when the app was down for me. Other than that I would definitely recommend this place. Can’t beat the location, it’s close to a lot of breweries and art in the RiNo district. Also, very close to downtown Denver."
110101,15869291,197754530,2017-09-26,1752169,Nicky,Lovely apartment with all mod cons! Megan was a supremely friendly and accommodating host - would definitely stay again!

237932,35351688,555585821,2019-10-27,46590986,Juan,"We had a wonderful stay at Abesom’s apartment! I wasn’t sure what to expect since it’s a basement apartment, but it certainly exceeded our expectations. It is a beautiful place - very clean, cozy, and has a very modern, welcoming feel. There was more than enough space for our group of 4 - we were very comfortable. It was also great relaxing on the couch with the big screen tv in the evening after a long day of exploring the city.

Abesom was a great host - he was very responsive and easy to communicate with. He also had bottles of water, coffee and several snacks for us in the apartment, which was really nice. I would definitely recommend the apartment and the host!"
16153,2257217,54371122,2015-11-19,2962560,Shannon,"My stay was so short - arriving late and leaving early - that I never got to meet Beth, but she was very welcoming and responsive over text message. She also left notes around the house with instructions, including for making coffee and breakfast, which I appreciated.

The listing is accurate - this is a small room in an extension of the house. In the winter temperatures, it was quite cold for the first few hours until the space heater caught up."
147992,20652963,444305934,2019-04-27,146743954,Jessica,This was a wonderful accommodation for our trip to Denver. Close to restaurants and sites. Very clean and easy to access! Ryan and his family were great hosts.

237276,35100738,479905872,2019-07-01,39723647,Kate,"Be mindful that there is NO AC in this room! In the description it says there is a small (not ceiling) fan in the room but should also say that is because there isn’t AC. I realized that in the amenities list it says there’s no AC, but it’s kind of an expected thing in this country so we never really read through the amenities. I feel it should have been made more clear in the description. It also felt like the window was left open in our room all day, making it really hot in the room. If it had been left closed and only opened at night, it probably would have been a little more tolerable. It was so hot in there we slept with no covers at all (not even the sheet), nearly no clothes on, it took us at least 3 hours to fall asleep and we slept with cool wet wash clothes on our necks. Besides the AC thing, this place was fine."
97451,14627385,259253283,2018-04-30,8661684,Justin,"Sean has a great space that is accentuated by his great attention to detail and determination to be as responsive as possible. 

You’ll love having your own little private suite downstairs, the bathroom is a bit small but not an inconvenience at all. 

I would absolutely love to stay with Sean again!"

Parking is great and is within a locked gate. The space exceeded my expectations and didn’t feel like a basement apartment at all! It was a perfect space to relax. The outdoor area is nice and very private. They have created a very inviting, comfortable and safe space. The hospitality was a amazing and I highly recommend this one!"

111163,16054644,204155985,2017-10-16,3813921,Amedeo,"My friends and I were visiting to see the Broncos play.  Josh was super responsive, had a book with very helpful guidance on the neighborhood and an all around great host.

The place was a great size 2-BR with a cozy backyard and a kitchen stocked with goods for us to use.  The lockbox access is great to make check in efficient.

Only catch that I didn't notice in the listing was no tv but not a big deal with so much to do in and around Denver.  The location is not immediately downtown but it's in a cool art community and Uber coverage is very good. Overall a great stay!"
171980,22731673,488898504,2019-07-15,29160302,Gary,"We were in Denver for a family wedding and rented this wonderful Craftsman style house which is in a quaint and charming residential area yet close enough to walk to terrific nearby restaurants .  This warm and welcoming house became home base for our family, and we loved to gather both on the front porch and the back deck.  The house was a huge hit!  It was exactly as described and had even  more charm than words can describe.  Jeremy was extremely accommodating and we cannot wait to come back and stay again.   The best breakfast place --- SNOOZE -- is a short stroll away.  A side note --- two of the  bathrooms feature bidets which were the talk of our stay.  LOL!  We actually went on Amazon and purchased two of the same bidets for our own house!!!"

Sheila has put everything you need in here and more! I traveled with my wife and 10 month old baby and we had all the comforts of home while being away from home, it was perfect! We never meet Sheila, but she was very clear and prompt with all communications. We especially loved the back yard and quiet neighborhood."

143332,20009659,503825507,2019-08-06,31919733,Santi,"I originally planned an extended stay for a month between the end of my lease and closing on my new house. Since it was me and my dog, options were somewhat limited. Brooke was extremely kind and accommodating and even allowed me to come see the place in advance before committing. The initial visit seemed great but unfortunately in the time between my first visit and move-in, there was some water damage to the basement level. Since the windows don’t open and there’s poor airflow, there were significant issues related to air quality and humidity/water damage. Unfortunately because of some breathing issues, I had to move out early. 

To her credit, Brooke is an extremely kind and gracious host but the basement suite could use a bit of work."

The only issue might be staying here during hot summer months because there is no A/C in the basement. However, we opened the windows at night and slept just fine. During the day it was a bit too warm. Otherwise, the suite was perfect. The bed was comfortable, we had cable TV, privacy, and a very relaxing back yard after a long day exploring Colorado. "

There were several extra amenities that we really appreciated like board games, extra blankets, a well-equipped kitchen, and the office was wonderful since 3 of the 4 of us had to work remotely during our stay. The neighborhood was a quick drive to downtown but not too busy, and there was plenty of street parking available. Would love to book again the next time we’re in town!"
116451,16589595,289587093,2018-07-12,133649474,Kaitlyn,"The room was secluded, cozy, and quiet.  The hosts were flexible with my check-in time and were quick to respond to any questions I had. I would definitely stay here again!"
101154,15026012,297943635,2018-07-28,198916253,Christina,Shannon’s place was very cozy and comfortable! She was a friendly host and responded very quickly to any messages we sent. 
241349,37151782,556896961,2019-10-30,94887278,Mathew,"Michael's place is a great location with a cool looking carriage house. The off street parking is very convenient given the lack of street parking in the neighborhood. The house itself is newly renovated and very nice looking. However, this does not offer some of the amenities that you would expect in an airbnb including toiletries in both bathrooms."
239058,35879415,496593063,2019-07-27,149686137,Katie,"Excellent communication throughout, perfectly clean, and you couldn’t ask for a more ideal location to stay near the Denver Airport!"

We had the honor of being the first airbnb guests, and we were delightfully surprised about how cute and nice the apartment was. Great backyard for dog lovers, great alternative to a hotel - feels totally private. We will stay again if we can next time in Denver!"
216393,29442234,357222787,2018-12-09,222726422,Celestial,Nicole was wonderful and place was beautiful. Perfect location and felt just at home there! Would definitely recommend!
100537,14980203,179511088,2017-08-07,143458261,Josephine,"Great location that is far enough from the hustle and bustle from downtown but close enough to get to quickly by car or public transit. Beautiful homes in Stapleton sets the stage for Corny's beautiful abode. Comfortable beds and nice sized bathroom. If you like to relax by taking a nice bath before snoozing, then you're picking the right place! Corny is very sweet, full of advice and respectful of your privacy. One of my favorite spots was her little secluded backyard if you wanted to take in the fresh air."

162926,21796586,476227065,2019-06-25,267188841,Erin,"Alicia and Josh have mastered airbnb. This place is immaculate and perfectly decorated. They go above and beyond to make your stay as relaxing as possible. They labeled everything. They provide chargers that fit our phones, snacks, water and toiletries. It’s super convenient to the airport. They are not intrusive at all, but available should you need anything. We would totally stay here again!"
10445,1189999,77065004,2016-05-30,68238304,Shelly,"The instructions on how to get in to the basement apartment were very clear and easy. As expected, we were happily greeted by the sweet puppy dog, Shy! The space was great for the three of us over the long weekend. Kitchen was fully stocked with all necessary utensils and items, which was really nice since we ended up cooking in for breakfast. Check out instructions were very clear and simple as well. Only thing to note was that since it is a basement apartment, the temperature controls were not accessible and nights/mornings were a little chilly! (I'm also from Texas and therefore a huge baby when it comes to cold weather). Overall, great experience at Mike & Rachel's! "
216264,29423431,345331882,2018-11-04,163500197,Sandra,"Ryan's place is by far the best place I have stayed at! Location is perfect. The apartment was beautiful! Everything was clean, neat and stylish. Great communication. The private patio is super cool ! If you are planning a trip in the area I recommend staying here!"

184539,24101544,550474855,2019-10-18,68558694,Alexandra,"Wanted to love this airbnb but too many missteps along the way made this stay fairly frustrating and would likely not stay here again. Want to say that the hosts were very communicative - but feel it's important for people to hear our experience. Bulleted list of our experience below: 

* I have never in my history of using AirBnB been offered early check in for a fee - they were offering a $25/hour fee to allow us to enter the premises at all before check in

* This property seems to be underwritten by a property manager - which meant that a lot of the information on the airbnb listing was different than what was listed in the apartment (wifi passwords, etc.) 

* Woke up to the balcony door wide open (we did not open it while here) and had issues locking the door (the hosts were very communicative about this) 

* WiFi does not allow for streaming - we re-set the router and tightened the coaxial cable and couldn’t stream anything (made frustrating as this was a work trip and we needed reliable WiFi) 

* Tried using the washing machine which then stopped mid-cycle, filled the apartment with the smell of sewage - we then had to find a laundromat to finish cleaning our sopping wet clothes

* The thermostat is locked which makes the guest unable to change 

* Directions to the garbage cans were unclear / we looked around the entire property and couldn’t find them 

* A few minor details - condo does not seem kept up with, fitted sheet in one of the rooms did not fit and kept falling off the bed while sleeping, etc

Ultimately the location is great - and this property could probably work if you’re in town for a fun weekend - but I suggest you pass if you plan to stay longer than two nights and/or need reliable wifi to work."
159154,21459839,345693669,2018-11-05,15239953,Purvi,"Really loved the space. The amenities were high quality, great location, and very good space for large groups!"

Everything was exactly as Jack and I had communicated beforehand and we would definitely stay there again when we make it back to Denver."

She was very understanding and accommodating.  Linda has great suggestions on places to visit, restaurants and attire needed for activities.  There was nothing I needed that she did not provide.  I highly recommend this Airbnb and I will look forward to staying there again when I visit my son next."

Although we did not meet, we felt extremely comfortable with all the check-in instructions, including key retrieval and parking. The apartment was absolutely lovely. Quiet, comfortable, and in a great neighborhood. It was close to downtown Denver and very easy to access the surrounding mountains, rivers, and hiking.

We would definitely recommend Katey and the apartment to all Denver travelers!"
167645,22264680,314435347,2018-08-26,138150062,Robert,Arthur and Lola have an amazing place only minutes away from downtown. They were easy to get in contact with  and I will be contacting them again next time we have a large group in Denver.
232631,33557673,464092709,2019-06-04,3033295,Erin,"Daniel’s place was a perfect location for our brief overnight stay in Denver, making our way across the country on a road trip - if we had more time, I would have loved to stay longer! It is centrally located to restaurants, parks, the zoo and other adventures and the space itself is very cozy and comfortable. Daniel was responsive throughout the booking process and available during our stay. I would absolutely recommend staying in the carriage house to anyone visiting Denver. Hope to come back soon!"
117747,16807778,136136204,2017-03-08,107962206,Krystal,Johnny & Micayla were extremely helpful with the last minute booking! Great people & great house! Cat is extremely friendly! Responded to my request within minutes!

We didn't need it but looks like parking may be an issue.  Place was clean and quiet. Highly recommended, would definitely book again. Thanks!"
242412,37718852,534414857,2019-09-22,5334825,Tim,Sarah is a very responsive and flexible host. The units are as pictured but it should be noted that the basement has an open air ceiling into the main upstairs unit so sound is prevalent going both ways. Note one of the two bedrooms does not have any windows. It's called out in the listing but not there is no kitchen nor TV so this unit is perfect if you have several plans in Denver and just need a place to sleep.
26681,4227772,171451121,2017-07-17,1231354,Louis,"Lynne's place was perfect. Great location, unit, and host! Would highly recommend and I will be booking again in the future! Thanks Lynne!"

37368,5990927,49946797,2015-10-07,45374316,Josh,Rogers apartment was very clean and comfortable. His instructions for check in/out were very detailed and covered everything you need to know. He stopped by to make sure that everything was going fine and to check if I needed anything. It was a great stay!
22519,3686629,158455526,2017-06-06,29321253,Shaneka,"Jamie and Maia's place is as pictured. Clean, comfy and in a great location. The bed was firm, no problems with AC and their blinds worked great at keeping sun out in the early morning. The home was in walking distance from many bars, food places and cafes (Crema was our favorite, they make their own bread and all that we got there was delicious.) It was 10 minute drive from the Denver Botanic Garden & about 30 from Red Rocks Park and Amphitheater. If you love green spaces, be sure to check those out! We did end up having to buy our own soap and lotion, so bring those amenities. Other than that, there were 2 towels available for use and travel size tooth paste looked to have been left behind by others. Would definitely stay here again! Highly recommend it."

And the bed is so big and comfy! The only thing to note is that the upstairs gets a bit warm during the summer. Would rent again!"
86168,13449331,166869116,2017-07-04,57246311,Jane,"5 of us stayed here for five nights for a wedding.  Everything seemed clean and new, and king beds were fabulous, though sofa bed not so much.  Very well equipped kitchen. Had some trouble with cable access one night; Gary responded promptly and had it sorted in no time.  Good freeway access and interesting (and safe) neighborhood.  No complaints and would definitely stay again."

He was incredibly accommodating with my stay in CO and he truly does go above and beyond to ensure your comfortable and have everything you need. He's thoughtful and he cares. Without hesitation, I would highly recommend Paul's place to anyone!!"
68670,10500808,187229313,2017-08-26,49738548,Steve,"Emily's place was everything we could have hoped for. Great location (on a quiet, private block with ample street parking, while only a quick walk away from the nightlife in HiLo, and a quick car ride/cheap Lyft to just about anywhere else in Denver), and it has everything you'd need for a stay of any length. The decor is very tasteful and chic, and it makes the place feel like a much-loved home away from home. Emily was a great host and reached out to us to ensure we had everything we needed during our stay. The guidebook and guestbooks had great recommendations for things to do around town, including lots of nearby places. (If you're feeling indecisive about dinner, head to Avanti. Brunch? Try Root Down. Coffee? Head to Black Eye, or Crema, which is a little further out but totally worth it. Dessert? Little Man Ice Cream is an institution and it's in walking distance). We loved Emily's place and would stay again in a heartbeat...If you've read this far into my review, just stop now and book Emily's place before someone else does!"
108706,15807058,190250123,2017-09-03,63804255,Courtney,Such a cute and quiet place near a ton of great restaurants! Would recommend to anyone looking in the area!
235661,34366188,488797298,2019-07-15,77140560,Mandy,I really enjoyed my stay in Denver. Bella was extremely nice and helpful. I wish I could’ve talked to her more but I was running around Denver most of the time. The price was extremely affordable for the location which was close to everything and made ubering super affordable. Next time I’m in Denver this is the place I’d want to stay again.
23564,3882739,19752753,2014-09-17,21062716,Jenny,"Saying that our stay here was a great lodging experience is an understatement... Our accommodations far exceeded our expectations. The space was very homely. Nick was even so kind as to help us with our luggage, have snacks readily available, and coffee ready for brewing (it's the little things!). We would gladly stay again in the future without any hesitation."
204252,27271600,559263811,2019-11-03,94047475,Elizabeth,This place is clean and cute. Probably better in the warmer months as we walked into a freezing cold home that we just couldn't get to warm up enough. Ran into some issues that were probably because the previous renter didn't do as directed when they left and it wasn't checked or corrected before we arrived. Made for a bad stay for us.
182125,23880394,562336657,2019-11-10,21933625,Monique,Awesome location and the space had everything you could need. Great value for what you get! Don't pass up the chance to stay here

197170,26082896,334671958,2018-10-09,52265573,Kelly,"Banks is a great host-he texted my boyfriend and I the night we got in so we had his number in case we needed anything. We had everything we needed, the bathroom is right next to the room, the house is in a safe spot with a great coffee shop nearby, and the area is quiet at night. We loved the city and had a great time-I'd recommend this space to anyone looking for a relaxing stay in Denver!"

189037,24711150,328605866,2018-09-26,204344159,Jacquie,"This place was absolutely wonderful, we wanted to stay forever. The space itself was well thought out, quaint, cozy and peaceful. It was spotlessly clean and provided all necessities (wine and coffee) :) The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  The hosts were so kind and shared many places to visit in the area and gave my kids apples right off the apple tree in their yard!! The location could not have been more ideal, very close to Cherry Creek Mall and lots of local good food places we enjoyed. We also walked to Washington Park which my kids loved and was one of the best parks I have been to. Area was safe and family friendly. I was totally comfortable walking around being an out-of-towner. Will definitely stay again.. Honestly can't wait to go back!"
227614,32138363,519535904,2019-08-28,205587839,Amy,Beautiful apartment! It is sparkling clean and beautifully furnished.

90047,13751109,272633971,2018-06-03,20183241,May,"I highly recommend Tracy’s place to anyone looking to stay in Denver. Her location is perfect- right across from Little Man Ice Cream and Linger, and only a few blocks from Root Down. Downtown is less than a 10 min drive. It really helped that she had a private parking spot. Her place was exactly as shown, if not even better! She had everything you could need- Keurig, a couple bottles of water, Netflix. Tracy was very quick in responding, which was much appreciated when we had a last minute request for late checkout. We loved our stay here and would stay here again!"
122660,17329756,151956808,2017-05-14,68564583,Chiara,"This is the most lovely apartment, clean, well- furnished and with comfrotable beds. I must say that the pictures do not make justice of it, and it is actually much nicer than what the pictures suggest. I was there with my family, and the neighborhood was perfect for my 2yo, since we could just step out of the door and play on the sidewalk. 

Christina was a caring host."

Very well-stocked and comfortable. The locks on the entry and the individual doors are very nice and help make the stay easy and secure. 

The bed was comfortable, the blankets and sheets were clean everything was simple and lovely. Many small touches thought of. 

It’s about a 7 minutes Uber ($6) downtown and the grocery store and Subway is within walking distance. 

Coffee, tea and creamer is provided and condiments are available in the fridge. A variety of oatmeal’s and breakfast food is in the cupboards, too. They have made it easy for everyone to stay! Soaps and shampoos available, as well as q-tips and listerine, if needed.

The location was perfect as we were close enough to walk downtown, close to a safeway for groceries, but yet the street was quiet with plenty of parking for our rental car.  We felt completely safe in the location.  The bath had everything we needed, shampoo, conditioner, hairdryer, and lotion.  The kitchen as well with pots/pans, french press for coffee, but fyi no microwave - which we didn't need but I just happened to notice wasn't present.  The bed was comfy and we were very happy with our stay!  We would definitely stay there again!  Celia was great with communication as well.  Great stay!"

Next to everything important in Denver, this cottage is tucked away next to a disc golf course, making for very scenic views. The back garden yard adds to the character and completes the Colorado feel. Will be back, and will be doing some free marketing via word of mouth for this property in the mean time. "

Ample space for sleeping, an amazing backyard for bbq and hot tub was easy to use.  She had all amenities there including toiletries, towels and linens (with plenty extra).  The fridge was full of water and beer when we arrived and we were able to help ourselves to the full kitchen to make meals at home.  The check in and check out process could not have been easier and Shari was always a phone call away when we had any questions or concerns.  The location is great as everything you need is close and a short drive to downtown Denver, airport, and other landmarks when visiting.  She even ordered a coffee grinder when she found at the the one available wasn’t working.  Couldn’t have had a better experience in Denver in this wonderful house.  Thanks again Shari!"
86371,13449331,556046831,2019-10-28,283054269,Henry,This was our first time trying Airbnb and it was a great experience for my family.  My wife said no less than 5 times what a great idea it was to get an Airbnb instead of a hotel.  It was spacious and the flexibility of being able to have a kitchen to feed the little kids was great.  We were in town for a wedding and it was a quick 10 minutes to get to downtown Denver.

The location is ideal and the listing was clean. I would also point out that the check in process is easy and flexible, which really reduces the stress of that first day. 

The only thing I would point out is that the WiFi was not spectacular. It was mostly fine for browsing but slow for streaming and would occasionally drop out. If you need a reliable, fast connection, I would probably look elsewhere."

The bed was extremely comfy, the furnishings were super cozy and cute - you can tell they take great pride in making sure that their guests feel very welcome. I didn't hear their dogs at all, although I met them both and they are both really sweet and well-behaved. AJ and Kat are really cool and down to earth, I can see myself being friends with them. "

Walking distance to coffee and convenient store. Very peaceful neighborhood. The room it self was great! Very clean and comfortable. Loved it so much that we spent the last night in. Best part of staying there was waking up to the great sunrise that light up the room. Jim was easily accessible whenever we had questions. Definitely would go back for our next Denver trip!

Daniel was an excellent host in every way.  He was extremely quick to respond and made sure we had everything we needed.  The place is extremely clean, which was very important to us.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the kitchen is well stocked.  In addition, there were plenty of clean towels, toilet paper, shampoo, and soap in the bathrooms.

It is the house that you remember every time you are booking a new place and think “I hope this next one will be as good”. 

It is a beautiful, spacious home with great light throughout. There is plenty of room to unwind and the kitchen is great for cooking and hanging out. The hosts were also some of the most helpful and organized hosts I have stayed with. 

What a great trip."

She was extremely flexible, accommodating and communicative, and her place was perfect all for the activities that we were doing downtown.  It is located a great little quaint yet modern little neighborhood that is just a 15 minute walk to downtown.

The place itself is very clean, open and comfortable and has every convenience that a home could possibly need except a T.V. although we did not miss a T.V.  The neighborhood has lots of really nice and unique cafes, coffee shops, restaraunts, stores and shops; in fact, the neighborhood is known to have some of the best restaurants in Denver

if you are looking for a nice place to stay and you don't have to be in the heart of downtown.  I strongly recommend Becky's place!"

The key was left in a lock box for flexible check in as our group arrived. All kitchen necessities are provided, we actually used the kitchen every night to cook dinner. The backyard was spacious and fenced in, so it felt private.  There is a cute, lighted seating area to take in the fresh air. There were plenty of clean blankets and towels available upstairs as well, with access to washer and dryer. The place is set up perfect to not feel like you're stuck right on top of eachother. Briana even paid a parking ticket we received due to a street cleaning that happened during our stay. We especially enjoyed the map on display in the dining area to see where other guests had traveled to Denver from. We couldn't have asked for a more laid back experience for our trip. Thank you again for having us! We hope to be back again soon. "

Though we had few reasons to contact Jeffrey, when we did, his response was very quick.  The patio and backyard were an added addition.  Again, quiet, peaceful and comforting, with a view of the city.     
We enjoyed our stay and look forward to renting this home again in the future."

It is a very short ride from downtown Denver, and if that is the area you are planning to explore, you could easily get by on just an Uber. The house had lots of room, an awesome hot tub, and was comfortable. Jason did everything he could to make us feel at home and we are very grateful."

3987,548897,20024659,2014-09-22,17621512,Madison,"This small suite is the perfect place to stay for trips to Denver. It has all of the amenities I could ask for and is very close to fun locations in the city like Colfax Ave. where there are a lot of nice restaurants and bars, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and many others. It is also close to several park areas so that you can easily get out and get some exercise. I'd say the suite is the closest thing you could find to a hotel-quality accommodations without paying the hotel price. This place has definitely become my ""home away from home"" whenever I come to Colorado!"

59141,9108143,246654274,2018-03-25,39862796,Chase,"My girlfriend and I planned a long weekend vacation in Denver. We wanted to do some leisurely hiking and enjoy the cool bars and restaurants near downtown and in Five Points. This house proved to be the perfect launching pad for our weekend. 

The home is located in a perfect location. It's on a relatively quiet street about 3 blocks from one of the main entertainment drags in Five Points. Every morning we walked to a different coffee shop or restaurant. In the afternoons, we were able to walk to the nearby bars and breweries. And the nice downtown restaurants were a $5 Uber ride away. I seriously doubt there's a better located Airbnb property in Denver. 

The home itself is beautiful and very tastefully decorated. We were very impressed by the look of everything. The outdoor patio was the perfect place to relax outside in relative privacy. Ashlee and Graham provide a very comprehensive binder with information about nearby restaurants, bars, entertainment, etc. So kind and so informative. 

If you want to be centrally located to enjoy Five Points and downtown, stay at Ashlee and Graham's house."

It was quaint, clean, close to shops, parks and entertainment venues as well as Zipcar so all my needs were meet with just a short walk.  And if I had to go further, I never had to wait longer than 3  minutes for Uber.  Meghan was very helpful any time I needed anything.  I would recommend staying here should you ever visit Denver! "
25383,4052272,470058170,2019-06-15,260467273,Melissa,"This airbnb was nice, clean, and in a good location. The sunroom is a bit messy (not true to the photos), but once you get downstairs to the basement everything looks great! The bed does dip in the middle a bit so it was a little uncomfortable for two people. We did encounter a few insects (spiders, moths, beetles), but it wasn't excessive. The water pressure in the shower was amazing! We also loved being greeted by Ozone as we came and went. We left our cat at home so it was nice to have a dog there to pet/play with."

Neighbors are quiet and you don't hear much noise. My boyfriend and I stayed here with another set of couple friends and it was a little too crowded for all of us.

176647,23291173,333072409,2018-10-06,200013352,Alex,"If you are staying in Denver, this is the place to stay! Rich is there if you ever need him and can be completely out of your way if you don't.

I would absolutely stay here again the next time I am in Denver!"

Jorge had a quick reply rate and check in was easy. We were just disappointed by two things: 1.) There were no pots, pans or basic cookware despite his listing stating a fully equipped kitchen, so we were unable to cook our own meals or make coffee in the morning, etc. 2.) There was a mouse running around the kitchen floor at night. The host was aware of both of these issues but wasn’t very kind or receptive when I gave feedback about them. Other than that, Jorge’s place was good for the price."

The host was great and she communicated instantly if you have questions about your stay. It was a perfect stay for me and my husband. Definitely better than a hotel."

We were looking for a nice, quiet stay with limited host involvement, which is exactly what we got. This is not to say that he was not attentive to our needs or welcoming; Ascahalew reached out to us at least once over the trip to make sure that there was not anything else that we needed.

My only comment would be that his children were at times noisy, but this was expected given that we had been given ample warning ahead of time.

10/10, would go back and would recommend to friends and family."

The house was amazing - beautifully decorated and comfortable for the two of us - it's a luxury to travel and have your own room! The neighborhood sealed the deal for us - anytime we can walk 2 minutes to both a coffee shop and a bar is an A+ in our book. Not to mention this neighborhood had so many great restaurant options - we'll have to make it back just to try the ones we didn't have time for. We would definitely use Matt & Mandy's house next time we visit Denver and highly recommend it for the great house, great neighborhood and great hosts!"

225025,31520181,413645773,2019-02-17,155023132,Robin,"The apartment is brand new, very clean, and comfortable. Lynn had snacks and drinks available and was very accommodating. We really enjoyed our stay and plan on returning the next time we are in Denver."
219607,30148025,475656461,2019-06-24,137394542,Matt,"House was exactly as described.  Great location just out of downtown and had a nice backyard.  

Patricia was very quick to answer questions and went out of her way to have the lawn maintained so we could enjoy evening fires.

The price was amazing considering what a hotel cost downtown.  I stayed here for a trade show that was in downtown Denver and saved a ton of money.  The fridge was stocked with essentials to get us through the first day which was great.  

This was definitely a diamond in the rough."
40781,6515185,190992452,2017-09-05,149062340,Michael,Fantastic place with a great view. Close to restaurants and downtown as well. Take a walk around the art district to see some of the incredible graffiti.

236932,34818979,539094398,2019-09-30,26841834,Anne,"Aaron’s place has everything you need for a great stay. Old world charm with large spaces, high ceilings and architectural details, but with modern updates for comfort and ease of use. The beds were very comfortable, the shower was wonderful, and the kitchen was fantastic to cook in.  My family and I enjoyed the location as we walked to both the Botanical Gardens and the Art museums, and as well it is only a 5-minute walk to Trader Joe’s and restaurants. The enclosed porch area seemed to be a bit in transition with decor, but I very much enjoyed morning coffee there. Other great touches were the wall art and rugs, lots of books and numerous work spaces. The place is well-suited for a family or two couples - would stay again if we had the occasion."

51417,8211278,499577051,2019-07-31,11775871,Jessie,"Although I was there for a VERY short amount of time, Debbie was very quick to respond and willing to work with us without hesitation on an early checkin. They place was older, but that's what gave it so much character. I wish I could have enjoyed it more."
237845,35341541,542695157,2019-10-06,135817783,David,"This place is great. It exceeded my expectations. It’s very stylish, comfortable, and welcoming. Parking was easy despite not having a parking lot. It’s a nice and quick ride into downtown but there’s lots to explore right in the immediate area too. Great dining and drink options are within walking distance. It was really a wonderful stay. The staff I did communicate with were helpful and nice and even gave us some tide pods so we could do our laundry. Yes there was a washer and dryer in the unit. I can’t recommend it enough!!"

We were visiting Colorado for my boyfriends 30th birthday and it was with in walking distance to restaurants and only a six to ten minute Uber ride to downtown! The house was clean and spacious. The kitchen was great to cook in if you don’t feel like going out for every meal. We would definitely stay here again.

Our bedroom and bathroom were set up with so many lovely additions, such as coffee, a microwave, and shampoo and conditioner laid out in the room.

84142,13194349,130401504,2017-02-05,8513360,Karen,"I highly recommend this loft if you're looking for a place to stay close to restaurants and bars in Denver.  Also, if you're a tall person, the bed is large (king) and the shower is tall.  My 6'4"" husband says this is one of the most accommodating places for a tall person he's stayed at.  The loft is very clean and Josh was quick to respond to questions.  The walls are pretty thin - we heard a party down the hall one night and people talking on another night.  However, overall, it was quiet since the street is all residential.  Street parking near the loft is hard to find so the included parking spot was a real convenience."
72990,11482047,218284504,2017-12-11,75963042,Alexander,"The location is awesome. Walking distance to many restaurants and bars. Short drive to downtown and other attractions. The place itself was comfortable and clean. However, while this isn’t a big deal, do not expect the television to work. Upon checking in we discovered it didn’t work and the host informed us this was a new issue that just started, but looking at other reviews you can see this is not the case. Just plan for there to not be a working television. Besides that the stay was awesome. The location and price alone make this worth the stay!"
192733,25257667,407312686,2019-02-01,77792175,Lauren,"Very beautiful, clean, and comfortable home in a great location. Communication was easy with Shelley as well. Was an awesome stay."

But for the price, the place really does need a DEEP, DEEP clean and fresh coats of paints in the rooms.  It was just messy and felt dirty."
29627,4545539,289156733,2018-07-11,147970260,Frank,"Incredible place for the money, awesome bathroom, in a nice neighborhood, everything within walking distance and owners are very friendly and great to deal with."

The parking wasn’t very good since you have to wake up at 6 in the morning to pay for parking, we got two tickets for not being out there early in the morning even with a handicapped pass card. 
Other than that the stay was good."

We were within walking distance of so many fun shops and restaurants that we were out and about more than we thought we would be.  The location cannot be beat!  We will plan visits to Denver around the availability of this fantastic rental.

219426,30071949,525343717,2019-09-07,30104142,Tatyana,"The place for great accommodation for our needs. We had a party of 6 staying and just needed a place to sleep. It was very clean, beds were comfortable and the host quick to respond to our questions. As other people say we could hear the upstairs, and woke up a few times at night because of the dog running. Also, beware that AC unit is controlled by the host upstairs and it could get cold downstairs. The AC was blowing right in our heads one night, it was somewhat hot outside, and it was hard to warm up and fall asleep. Other then that everything was good. 
Thank you Alisha :)"

It was very hot the week that we stayed though, so be prepared for no AC (as listed) if you are going during the summer. Hosts were very helpful and easy to reach throughout our trip. Perfect spot for your Denver getaway!"

The space was clean with quirky decorations that gave it a homey feel, modern amenities, and even an air conditioner for the summer heat.

Mike was a gracious host with quick, clear communication throughout our entire trip.

Overall, a great place to stay with an awesome host! I highly recommend.  "

10606,1223593,133965609,2017-02-25,17523432,Sylvie,"Cynthia is a truly wonderful hostess, who takes the time to meet and greet her guests upon arrival, and to provide any information needed. She’s charming, interesting, and lovely to talk to. (She’s also a fluent speaker of French.) She makes you feel at home, and I left feeling that I had a new friend.
Great discussions with another guest as well!
The room was lovely, at once spacious and cozy, and well-appointed with a desk, chairs, ample closet space, a comfortable bed with a real eiderdown, books, art, plants, and a private bath that included a hairdryer and a box of tissues – details very much appreciated. 
Tea, coffee, and fruit were provided, as well as free use of the kitchen. Everything was made easy.
I found the location quite convenient. I walked downtown every day. There are a number of museums a short walk away, and a large park very close by. For those who like organic food, there’s a Natural Grocers nearby, and Whole Foods is not too far. Public transportation is also readily available less than two blocks away.
I enjoyed every bit of my stay and hope to return – thank you, Cynthia, for being so wonderful!

There were plenty of linens and towels, plus a kitchen that was ready to go if you wanted to stay in and cook. The backyard has a wonderful, beautifully lit patio perfect for enjoying evenings in the fresh air, plus a space for little ones to run and play. The on premise swing set was a hit with the kids. Walk in showers in both bathrooms are great and beautifully designed. There is one parking space in back off the street which is convenient though plan ahead if you have more than one vehicle. Parking on the street was never available unless it was middle of the day. Overall, a gem! You won’t be disappointed."

Their home is beautiful and the room/ bathroom is amazing. It is very clean, quiet and tranquil the hosts have thought of everything! It was so much better than staying at a hotel. Their attention to detail in assuring the comfort of their guest cannot be surpassed. Honestly, they have set the bar very high for any other hosts I may encounter. I would highly recommend Tiela's Place to everyone who asks! I can't thank them enough for sharing their home with me!"

107558,15746223,343194258,2018-10-30,41495461,Diandra,Eva’s place is a little gem! Everything is a $6-10 Uber/Lyft away! She was very nice and patient with us. She even arranged early check in for my sister since her plane landed Hours before check in. She literally has everything we needed. Definitely cozy for even 3 people but enough space to sleep comfortably!

The place is perfect for those traveling around the area but are looking for a place just outside the hustle and bustle.  Be aware that you can definitely hear the neighbors upstairs but it's nothing too annoying.  We would definitely stay at Craig's again when we visit Denver in the future!

Everything is close by and public transportation is fantastic! You can walk to many cafes, restaurants, museums, and bars. The 16th Street mall is close by and you can take the bus to Cherry Creek mall very easily!
The apartment was beautiful and well decorated. The bed was hotel quality: super cozy! The variety of books were nice to check out, and I even got to read one during my time there. 
There’s plenty of closet space, and the room is well lit. The towels are soft, and the whole place is very clean.
Denver was great as was Sydney! I booked this Airbnb the day before I arrived, and she responded quickly and thoroughly to any questions I had."

She provided incredibly detailed directions for getting to her home and how to get around town. The room is beautifully decorated and the bed is incredibly comfortable!  Casey was very responsive by email and text in the days prior to my trip. This really relieved a lot of stress for me!

Our room was delightful with just enough  personal touches that it felt like staying with loved ones. We were never with need- from parking down to a stocked fridge! Beautiful grounds and safe off street parking. As others mentioned Juan is the added bonus.  He was never intrusive but we chose to spend time chatting with him late into most nights in his beautiful court yard. We were a couple minutes from everything we wanted to do, at most 12 min from downtown and 30 for Boulder."
75720,12169927,252697892,2018-04-11,164812777,Alix,"The apartment is spacious, comfortable and well-appointed. In fact, exactly as advertised: the small children upstairs can be heard, at times but not in a disturbing way. 

The neighborhood and surrounding areas are reachable on foot. And there is lots to see.The Wooden Spoon was a highlight and I highly recommend it.

Vanessa and Gabriel’s list of places to visit and restaurants of all kinds was excellent. Highly recommend it."
51723,8338364,109133168,2016-10-19,4949932,Chelsey,"From the moment we booked, Jerry was so friendly and welcoming. He provided clear instructions well before our arrival, which was appreciated since there are so many last minute things to get done before heading out on vacation. The home itself was clean and decorated beautifully, and within walking distance to many things (which he outlined on the arrival sheet!). We would definitely stay here again! "

Highly recommend this place for both adults and small families."

40710,6515185,112570792,2016-11-06,92897310,Rian,This home was in a great location near tons of great restaurants and bars. It was just as pictured and equally great as all the previous reviews I had read. I only met two of the three hosts briefly in passing but they were very nice and welcoming. This was my first air B and B stay and I was very impressed. 
237255,35100738,461532166,2019-05-31,59083685,Kaylin,"We requested a stay at Zaid's place the day before we arrived in Denver, and their response was incredibly speedy!  I do not have a single complaint about this Airbnb --- their home was immaculate, it was easy to find, checking in was a breeze, the design was absolutely adorable, and they even offered us coffee on our way out. I would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a place to stay in Denver!"
132731,18775585,294212000,2018-07-21,37252528,Maria,This place is amazing! Pictures don’t do it justice. It is literally the nicest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. So sparkling clean!! Can’t say enough good things about it.

13596,1901266,77131805,2016-05-30,30151822,Abbe,"There is no more pampered place to be than Barbara's airbnb. Staying with Barbara is a real joy because she has thought of all the details to make your stay as welcoming and comfortable as possible. And if you need help or have a special request, she and her family jump in to do anything they can to accomodate. Her home is quiet and comfortable and a great location in central Denver. I have stayed in multiple airbnb homes around the country for the last year. Every airbnb had its own charm, but Barbara ' s really stands out as something special. I cannot give her and her family and home a higher recommendation and am looking forward to returning for another stay later this summer."
207233,27763772,335650370,2018-10-12,38519958,Anthony,"Perfect for what I needed. I was just passing through for the night. The place was clean, quiet, and accommodating. Timely and helpful responses from Vincent when needed. Good suggestions for nearby things to do. I basically landed in Denver, checked in to the room, had a nice meal at one of the suggested restaurants. Enjoyed a complimentary bowl of cereal in the early AM and was on my way. Minimal interaction with other guests during my stay but all seemed to be quiet and respectful. Booking would depend on your comfort level co-locating with other guests but at worst you have a private and cozy room/bed to yourself or with your significant other, etc."
164048,21849976,259306407,2018-05-01,59386948,Ryan,"Go out of your way to stay here, even if it means staying an extra night in Denver. From the four-legged friends to the awesome house with tons of character, to the perfect location, there's not a wrong choice here. Vincent and his crew are wonderful hosts."
116527,16589595,343729450,2018-11-01,123783322,Clare,"Tiela's place is convenient, clean, and quiet - perfect for landing place in between flights."

59156,9108143,261676029,2018-05-06,63215720,Brody,"Awesome space with an even better location.  Less than three blocks to Larimer street and all the great bars and restaurants RiNo has to offer.  But because it’s 3 blocks removed, you don’t deal with the noise when you want to escape.  Loved the outdoor space."
6683,769437,7843956,2013-10-05,8347647,Brandon,"This was my first AirBnB experience, and Simone and Joel made me feel right at home.  Beautiful space, hot shower, and great communication.  Couldn't ask for more!"

Immaculately clean with dishwasher, oven, refrigerator, and microwave in the kitchen.  The additional pull out coach was very comfortable with the tucked away 2 inch foam mattress!  I would come here again."

100528,14980203,166877744,2017-07-04,57370283,Sara,"This was my first time staying in a private room as opposed to a whole house/condo and it was wonderful. The two beds are comfortable and we had our own private bathroom. The accommodations were overall 5/5 and a great value for the price. The host is an extremely nice, welcoming woman and not overbearing or intrusive at all. We only really saw her twice during our stay, but she was full of recommendations and even drove us to the airport at 5am for cheaper than an Uber/Lyft would be.

The neighborhood that the home is in is awesome. The houses are all gorgeous and interesting, and it is so quiet and peaceful. This house is a very short walk from Stanley Marketplace, which has a ton of great restaurants and shops. There are also miles and miles of paths for biking, walking, running, etc. Getting downtown was about a $13 Uber ride.

Overall, this airbnb was exactly what we were looking for, a safe, great value, well-located home with a wonderful host. We would absolutely stay again."

44287,7203437,170984373,2017-07-16,121134506,Robin,"This is a great place to stay for a small group, family, or couple. A few girlfriends and I stayed here for our first holiday to Denver. Eryn and John are attentive hosts. Easy to communicate with. We initially were confused as to where we could park our car, but then found the information complete with pictures in the guest handbook (so helpful). It is cozy and decorated nicely. We went hiking in the mountains, which was not too bad of a drive. This place is a walkable distance from a few restaurants etc (we loved Lucile's for brunch!). Downtown is about a 8-10 minute Lyft or Uber ride. The patio is great for relaxing and has beautiful little lights in the tree that turn on at night. We really enjoyed our stay here and hope to come back sometime!"

Nancy has a house manual which makes it so easy to know your responsibilities and duties when staying."

The best part about the stay is Joe himself. We are looking at moving to Denver and Joe stepped us through every neighborhood and was available for directions and suggestions over our entire stay, a wealth of information for an out of town guest. I would come back as a customer or as a friend (especially to see the garden in the summer)"
234297,33969064,491836355,2019-07-20,114874321,Ronney,The location was great. There was plenty of space for two. The backyard was a perfect place to unwind from the day and private. The neighbors kept to themselves. The bidet was a pleasant surprise. Thanks again!

Lots of great restaurants and shopping nearby but we even walked to downtown - it took only 20 minutes. We felt very safe and always had a parking spot right in front of the house. Their back patio was really nice for a quick relax after being out in the evenings. The room was large and the bed was super comfortable. All in all, we had a great experience in a great house in a great location. The hosts were always quick to respond to any inquiries and the dogs were darling! Highly recommend!"
188214,24575590,264725607,2018-05-14,185770933,Tyler,There were 3 in our group and stayed for 5 nights. Great space underneath the hosts living area. It looks recently renovated. The hosts were quick to respond and provided us with all of the conveniences we needed. Plenty of books available as well as a small kitchen with stovetop and mini fridge. We did not get a chance to meet the hosts but felt as if they were always available should any problems arise. Would definitely stay again.
212314,28861024,529307633,2019-09-14,41799570,Amnon,"It was a solid home base for my work trip, but there were things that could be improved upon—the doors didn't close all the way, and the bed sheets and pillows seemed old. Apart from that the location is great, and Michael responded quickly to messages."
238042,35385881,542664160,2019-10-06,241714427,Benjamin,Expect an awesome host that will take the time to get to know you so that you have the best experience in Denver.
115884,16548314,227052643,2018-01-13,76620664,Allison,"Tomas’s apartment is even cozier than the pictures show. Tomas made it easy for us to check in even though we arrived later in the evening and the location is very convenient, right next to the Botanical Gardens and Cheesman Park. Our only regret was that we didn’t get to stay there longer than one night!"

125397,17638774,547295078,2019-10-14,250414403,Erik,"The place is very nice, clean, and in a great location. Walking distance from breweries, bars and restaurants. We were able to find free street parking a block away from the building, but parking is limited. I would recommend that the host get another key, as there was only one key and you need it for all amenities including the elevator."

Darrell was great - clear directions and communications - and he really does a nice job of leaving special little touches that you’ll appreciate. Quiet neighborhood. Easy access to stores, food, and dispensaries."

140844,19714594,233039670,2018-02-07,170792660,David,"Tobi's home is absolutely gorgeous and embeds a welcoming atmosphere. Through my trips across the US this has easily been the stay at an air bnb so far. If your in Denver looking for a place to stay, this is it."
110883,16037872,281353391,2018-06-24,195165753,Gerry,"This was my first time using AirBnb and I was extremely satisfied with the whole experience. Jess was very easy to communicate with and made the whole process very easy. My girlfriend and I went up there for a weekend and we wanted to make the most out of time in Colorado. Jess gave us some recommendations for day trips that made our time there unforgettable. Her Cozy Condo, is exactly that; It was very clean and neat and had all the amenities we could’ve asked for. After a long day of hiking, it was the perfect place to come and relax. Her place is also within walking distance to some cool restaurants and coffee shops, we stopped by Pablo’s Coffee every morning. We would definitely stay at the Cozy Condo again and would highly recommend it to anyone. "

44663,7305805,76151575,2016-05-25,14290451,Jess And Chris,"Carrie was a great host! I booked a last minute reservation at her place and she was very welcoming and accommodating. The place was clean and exactly what I needed for my short stay. The key exchange was very easy. Carrie offers secure parking in the garage where the room is accessed. All in all, very convenient and nice place to stay!"
1829,74125,30163686,2015-04-18,3668624,Alison,"Joe was extremely personable and quick to reply not only while booking his apartment, but throughout the stay as well. Keys were super easy to procure and I never had any issues throughout my stay (bar one minor toilet paper shortage.) Overall it was awesome to have the whole place to myself and the benefits of staying in an active apartment is that it is fully stocked with anything you could need. The downside of this was that it felt almost too lived it; as though Joe might come back through the door at any moment. TONS of random computers and junk lying around added to a cluttered feel, and definitely solidified my concern that there was no way this place had been cleaned in months. Cotton balls, coins, ear plugs, dust bunnies all scattered throughout the apartment. Towels and linens felt clean,  but worn. Definitely a casual, lived-in atmosphere. Wish it felt just a touch cleaner, but as far as communication goes, Joe was great."
161146,21667826,239210195,2018-02-28,73942002,Perla,"Simon and Aurora’s is fantastic. Super clean, spacious and with all the amenities and more than a multi star hotel. Denver is so much fun and the cottage is smack in the middle of amazing life on Larimer. We recommend Hotbox for breakfast and doughnuts - and Monkey theorem for wine.

Much better than any hotel and the hospitality was outstanding. Thanks again Simon and Aurora."
97766,14724270,456854357,2019-05-22,76532506,Qinyu,"I had a great stay at Robert's and Mandy's! The house is old, but the interior furnishing is amazing! Robert just moved an arcade machine that's free to play to the house too, so that's rad. The location of the house is near to the light rail for accessibility to downtown Denver (it is close enough to walk too), and it is also close to the Rino district, another notable area of interest in Denver. Robert and Mandy are excellent hosts- I had the opportunity to meet both of them and they were always quick to respond to any queries I have as well as recommended great places to dine! Highly recommend this accommodation, its great value for money"
183144,24017637,290565704,2018-07-14,33825274,Stuart,Great location for Mile High Stadium and a stones throw from downtown Denver. Really cool space and plenty of room.

60696,9250245,222046677,2017-12-28,30107624,Nico,"Rob was fast, accurate, and very helpful whenever communicating with him. The Loft is unique and more spacious than the photos let on. It's in a great location that's close to a lot of restaurants. I would recommend eating out as the loft isn't really setup for home cooking."
155160,21126734,508402826,2019-08-12,31238132,Aimee,Perfect place for our little girl getaway. The location was awesome and it had just what we needed.

There must’ve been a catch, but everything was perfect as it seemed online! Paige is the most thoughtful and gracious host. She provided us with all the information we needed. The location was clean and comfortable.  The kitchen was open and contains everything one needs. The beds, bathroom, backyard, modern sound system, and outdoor hot tub were excellent! Location is incredible, very convenient, near bars and walking distance to downtown!

We loved our stay.

Thank you Paige and Denver for a wonderful weekend!"

Let's first start out by stating how proactive/accommodating Elizabeth was to make the check-in process super easy.  She even checked up on me several times to make sure things were going well and that we safely got into the house.    

The property is gorgeous and can easily house six.  It was equipped with a fully stocked kitchen, comfortable dining room area, clean sheets, clean towels, travel shampoo, and body wash.  The living space hash plenty of comfortable seating and even a third bedroom area with a movie theater-type set up.  There's a enclosed private outdoor area with a little lawn where your group can hang out.  There's even a private single car garage space attached to the building.  

The neighborhood is great- plenty to eat, imbibe, and do in the area within walking distance.   

OH! and Elizabeth left some delicious hand-made spiced chocolates for us to indulge on, which was a pleasant little welcome.  "

It is quaint, beautifully decorated and clean.  The apartment is located in a wonderful historic neighborhood.  The area is very quiet and charming. There are many great local eateries down 32nd Street.  The apartment Is close to downtown. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and my stay at this place. Sarsha is a great host and responded quickly to my inquiries. This is definitely the place to stay when in Denver. "

128913,18256642,522987942,2019-09-02,270757975,Erin,"Lucy's place was clean and everything was as expected. The neighborhood is pretty walkable to locations downtown and even towards Tennyson. We found that most Lyft prices were a lot higher than other guests mention in their reviews ($15-25). The only time we were able to catch a Lyft for under $10 was late at night or  early in the morning. Not Lucy's fault, but something for other guests to keep in mind if that's their planned mode of transportation. Other than that, we had no issues and we'd definitely recommend to other guests."

The mattresses were very comfortable, and there was more space than I expected. The condo is located in a good part of Denver, and if you don't mind a little stroll, there are several good places to eat and to explore nearby (including voodoo donuts). 10/10 would stay there again."

21641,3487191,35526140,2015-06-19,9032848,Georgette,"Nathen was easy to communicate with and accommodated me so nicely when my other plans fell through and I requested to stay the day of the booking. He is a very sweet guy and the inside of the place was great! I expected an efficiency and it was a full 1-bedroom apartment - the bedroom, literally fit the bed, but there was nothing I lacked for. I walked to everything I needed, restaurants, shops, there was even a UPS print shop, hospital and goodwill all a few blocks away but it was quiet and I was able to work and play. It's a nice neighborhood as well. "

It's a little hard at first to find because it's facing an alley, but it provides additional privacy in the yard and in the home. Kristin was very helpful and responsive in answering our questions - I had trouble during check in with the bluetooth keys, but she was quick to help figure it out. Also, bookers should be aware that Kristen prefers to book only with those users with a booking history or reviews. If you're traveling with a group, plan head to have a main point of contact with an established AirBnB account. Would travel there again!"
59070,9108143,178459521,2017-08-05,83487899,Rachel,"I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while in Denver.  Ashlee and Graham really thought of every little detail when preparing the home for out of towners.  The space was not only clean, but homey and perfectly decorated.  We actually enjoyed spending time in the Airbnb while resting in between activities.  I can't recommend this home enough.  Thanks for a great stay!"

The neighborhood is very quiet and nice for walks. Close to downtown and airport as advertised. This location is in the basement of the home they live in. There is a separate entrance to the basement, which is nice. You do have to go in through the garage which is noisy. There is also noise from children, so don't plan on sleeping in. Also, the bed is VERY soft. 

All in all, great place. Clean, great location, and easy to communicate with the owners. Just would have been nice to have read a more thorough review before we went. "

Also Leanne's communication was great, quick responses and very easy going when planning the trip.  Also she was great about giving me heads up about the parking restrictions (construction area/ street cleaning) that were going during my stay.

Will surely stay again if I'm back in town again"

They made my stay feel like staying with family, it was so comfortable! I could have spent the whole night petting their adorable dog Archer."
118418,16857174,230011413,2018-01-26,8641033,Dan,"Rodney was great.
Super informative of where everything was, he made sure I had everything I needed.
I was very exhausted when I got there from traveling, he was very polite and made sure I was comfortable.
Unfortunately we had very limited face to face time, but he was very nice and respectful of my privacy."

203123,27064399,345927442,2018-11-06,223056789,Christopher,"As a band traveling across the states, finding a night to get out of the van, sprawl out and rest is quite a rare treat. This space made our night off wonderful and cozy. 

I really liked the combination of 1950s design with lots of modern touches — very cool. 

We were welcomed by our host and felt right and home immediately. 

Great house close to a lot that Denver has to offer."

231604,33314396,559696259,2019-11-04,61999461,Jordan,Jeremy and Jenn's place is awesome! The space has everything you need and is clean and comfortable. The location is great for walking around Denver but there are also plenty of Lyft/Ubers available. Jeremy and Jenn responded to us very quickly and were super accommodating. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Denver!
169457,22463317,330591696,2018-09-30,6288528,Kjersten,Shalom is a friendly and accommodating host. Very communicative. The place was as described.

234989,34204214,448882653,2019-05-05,148563340,Vanessa,"This humble abode is most definitely a hidden gem nestled among Denver's vastness. Conveniently located only 13 minutes from the spectacular Red Rocks and 22 minutes from downtown, it was sure to please with its suburban rural feel. Inside you are met with a touch of 1950's flavor, Native American flare crossed with a feel of modern hominess, a pet friendly welcome and a fun loving quirkiness. Both Alan & Cathy were hospitable hosts who aimed to please. We couldn't be anymore satisfied with this Airbnb it went above & beyond our expectations that we were honored to be its first guests.
If we are ever back in the Denver area we will be sure to definitely book this listing again!!
Thank you again Cathy & Alan for making our stay a treasurable one.
Definitely an Airbnb worth experiencing <3"
143891,20170743,245073334,2018-03-20,169318528,Ben,"Brady’s place was in a great location and made it easy to walk/Lyft anywhere in Denver. The place was clean and he provided us with fresh linens and a dining set in case you were wanting to eat in. All in all, we really enjoyed our trip and would not hesitant to book with Brady again."

58176,9009513,104721526,2016-09-28,76745480,Evan,"This little basement apartment was absolutely darling. I would recommend this rental to everyone. Location was great, apartment was adorable and clean, and Katie made everything so easy. 

I am looking for another reason to make it back to Denver just to stay again. :)"

She had  beautiful artwork displayed and gave my husband and I a book filled with suggestions of things to do in Denver. I would highly recommend her place if you’re coming to Denver.

94833,14187514,486467127,2019-07-12,235929077,Brad,Terrific place to stay while in Denver. We went to the Alamo Drafthouse just down the street to unwind. Robert and Vance were super responsive and the porch was a great place to hang with my coworkers and unwind.
73414,11521979,500110246,2019-08-01,34446364,Jessica,"We stopped in at Jenna’s place for just a night and absolutely loved it. Jenna was so accommodating and even made sure we got in okay after a long, delayed flight. The location could not be better, the apartment was incredibly clean- we felt like we were the first guests in a new place. Would definitely stay again- I highly recommend!"
235699,34396290,550474408,2019-10-18,76225961,William,McAnthony's place is a good place to stay if you need to crash for a night.  The kitchen and living room are shared spaces and the rest of the house are individual rooms airbnb to other guests. If you don't mind running into other people in the house this is perfect.  The room we stayed in was big with mainly just a bed. Check-in was very easy. The internet wasn't working when I was there so that was an inconvenience and I had another guest come knocking on our door asking about the internet.  The place does have a laundry machine and that was important reason why I chose to stay here since we were on a long road-trip.
239405,36036522,531072565,2019-09-16,148992053,Calli,This was a perfect space and location for visiting Denver! Check in and check out was easy with a key code. You had a nice and clean space. We walked to tons of local breweries and restaurants within less than a mile. Also only a 10 min walk to the train station to get you right downtown and throughout the city. Parking was ample in front of the house too. Would definitely stay again!
225846,31666998,541643460,2019-10-05,86793204,Chase,"I’ve never felt more at home during a stay anywhere! Wonderful amenities like coffee and light breakfast fare, including a delicious homemade granola, great with the milk or yogurt provided, as well as space heaters, humidifiers, and these ingenious little vent fans to circulate cold air better. Todd and Becca provided superb recommendations and were near instant in communication. They also provided an extra blanket for our chilly concert at red rocks. I will definitely look to stay here again if I’m ever in this area."
101131,15026012,232840250,2018-02-06,158618733,Abhimanyu,She’s just amazing and yes you have to stay here.
207561,27806389,516621939,2019-08-24,108604028,Ed,"If you’re not tolerant of shared spaces or 420/710 this place isn’t for you. I enjoyed my stay. Was a but more like a hostile than I expected... there just wasn’t a curfew 

I had some good conversation with several of the long term tenants. That alone is what makes me want to visit again.

P.S. The art they have in the hall is pretty awesome. I think they should share some shots of it in the listing."
4650,662431,185796369,2017-08-22,59221849,Rumour,"Wonderful stay! The location is fantastic! The studio was well appointed and smartly decorated with all of the comforts of home! It can be a little noisy if there is a family is staying above you, but Tim provided a sound machine and ear plugs to help with reduce noise. Would definitely stay again!"
192698,25257591,523904646,2019-09-04,88478378,Katie,We really enjoyed our stay at Beth's place. There are shops and restaurants close by - we visited Lowry town centre most days for breakfast which was less than a 5 min drive. You can catch a bus at the end of the road which takes you to Downtown Denver. We definitely benefited from hiring a car in order to see the sites outside of the city. Beth's place was clean and tidy. We bumped into her and her beautiful puppy a couple of times in the garden - Beth is very friendly and helpful!
233708,33832772,443299868,2019-04-25,90708495,Mia,"we had a great stay in this clean and cozy apartment, quiet area, but really close to the center! Jeremy helped us instantly with all our questions and needs. Highly recommendable!"
157868,21328844,430426291,2019-03-30,250481872,Andrew,"Jason is a great dude, always checking up and seeing if everything is up to par. Quick responses between him and Barb getting back to you when you have a question , great communication and hospitality. The apartment itself doesn’t fall short either, it’s spacious, clean and organized and more than someone could need and ask for. So many small and thoughtful amenities like microwave oven, mini fridge, coffee maker, cups and disposable “silverware”, it’ll make you want to look out for his place the same way he’s looked out and took care of you by giving you everything you need"
212730,28931478,362618623,2018-12-26,36439805,Kara,We had a wonderful stay at Robert’s place! The amenities and thoughtful touches were above and beyond. Robert was so easy to communicate with and always responded very quickly. We were so happy with our stay!

98813,14800540,305085174,2018-08-10,30973700,Janki,"Wow. Kathryn's place was amazing. The location was great, the apartment was spotless and Kathryn was so accommodating. She went above and beyond on the personal touches within the Airbnb. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone interested."
35588,5619534,82488938,2016-06-27,10744552,Sonja,"It was a very convenient location and there was ample space which was terrific. Guests should be aware though that Ricardo may be very present during ones stay and while we were visiting he asked to stop by the residence during our stay to get books and additionally he was on the property each morning to water plants. This is totally fine if you're not on a romantic stay but it might be intrusive if you're looking for privacy. That being said, he is very responsive and kind. "
184625,24159249,266891199,2018-05-20,7379800,Allison,"This place was wonderful. Definitely as advertised—extremely modern, clean with all the amenities! The neighborhood is very quiet & residential. Would absolutely stay again!"

239180,35936980,567138480,2019-11-21,310734073,Shannon,"This is a really nice, kept up house. It was easy to find, able to park right at the house. All of the house mates were very friendly even though none of them seemed to know I was coming and didn’t seem familiar with Airbnb guests staying over. The bedroom was clean and ready, the shared bathroom was clean too. They responded to my messages immediately and were very helpful. It worked great for me as I just needed a place to sleep and shower for the night. If you have plans and will be exploring around town it would probably be perfect. If your plan is to lounge at the house you’ll be lounging with a handful of other people whom live there. Even with all the people moving around making dinner and socializing my room was still quiet."
9683,1042331,235727966,2018-02-17,147060899,Katie,"My boyfriend and I were at Annette's for over a month while we waited for our new condo to be completed. I would definitely recommend Annette's for a long weekend or even week long stay while visiting the Denver area. The location is perfect. It's close to fun Tennyson Street (shops, restaurants, and bars), highway 70, and only a few minutes from downtown Denver and the popular LoHi area. The apartment is suitable for a couple with a queen bed, kitchen, and bathroom. There is not a TV, which made our month long stay a little more difficult, but because of it's location, short-term residents will have plenty to do and will rarely spend time in the apartment. Wifi was good. My boyfriend and I both work from home and we had zero issues. The apartment is also pet-friendly with a huge front yard and excellent proximity to a dog park. Overall, while the styling of the apartment is considered more ""old fashioned"", it is functional. Our only disappointment was the cleanliness of the dishes & kitchen, and this could have been the responsibility of the previous resident. When all is said and done, had we brought up any of our concerns to Annette, she would have done everything she can to fix it (even while overseas). Thank you Annette for housing us! We are excited to move into the neighborhood!"

- Parking was easy and convenient (be careful on Wednesdays).

- The house was gorgeous outside and inside! It’s like one of the homes you envy on Pinterest!!

- The bedroom was wonderful. It was quiet and peaceful. The bed was so comfortable and the abundance of pillows was heavenly! 

-The bathroom was sparkling clean!

We especially loved the private bathroom on our floor level. The kitchen was shared and clean and pristine. Bathroom included shampoo and body wash if needed as well as a blow dryer and fluffy clean towels. Room was spacious with clean sheets and a roomy closet type space which was perfect for storing luggage and changing in for privacy. We enjoyed our stay so much that while we were traveling we booked it twice in one week!"
113997,16304484,471030915,2019-06-16,241118053,Jamie,"Great space and neighborhood when visiting Denver. The unit had a lot of great touches (ie a USB plug unit close to the bed for plugging in your phone). The only downside was the height of the ceiling in some areas, especially over the bed. I’m 5’6” and had no issues but my fiancé is 6’4” and had to duck and bumped his head a number of times. We would absolutely stay again and recommend the unit but that was the one thing we would have changed."

It has its own atmosphere, very quiet peaceful, located in the very nice and friendly neighborhood. I had a car, so it was easier for me to find around the places I needed! Parking is next to the house, that is very convenient, 15–20 minutes to downtown of Denver . Kitchen has everything you need to cook, bed is comfortable and cozy.
I would definitely recommend that place for singles and couples and I’m coming back for sure! Thanks again Travis, for everything! Sincerely, Galina"

We loved being close to the park too. The small apartment was everything that we needed with an awesome bathroom. No kitchen, but between all of the restaurants, trader joes and whole foods we didn't feel like we needed it. There was a mini fridge there that worked just great. This was our first time using airbnb and Susan and Matt set the bar high!"

The room and house has a lot of character and all the personal touches Pamela has put in to the morning tea and coffee and treats to the shared living room and dining room area added to our memorable stay.

The kitchen was well equipped and the entire place was very comfortable and charming.  We enjoyed walking a couple of blocks to Wash Perk, for morning coffee, and found the convenience of Whole Foods handy as well. It was very wintry while we were in Denver, but Gary’s place was toasty and snug."

234916,34151881,467709606,2019-06-10,16833491,Kevan,Luis and Chris's place was perfect for a weekend getaway in Denver. Super easy to get in and out and looked just as advertised. The unit is in a very walkable area in Capitol Hill and close to the Botanical gardens and Cheesman Park.  You can easily get around by rideshare or bike to downtown and RiNo.  The space was very clean and had morning coffee on the deck space everyday.   Thank for the stay.

125251,17623101,425651063,2019-03-18,17655397,Leslie,"This is a beautiful house in a great neighborhood - the house is stylish and the photos are not misleading. It was also clean and well-appointed and it came close to being one of the nicer AirBnBs I've ever stayed in. That said, 3 out of 4 of the beds are VERY uncomfortable - and that impacted our stay considerably. Three of the beds seem more like futons than mattresses. I hate saying this because the hosts were great (we had a small problem upon check in and they were very responsive; the problem was quickly fixed), but this place needs new beds, full stop. If you're either one couple that will only use the master bedroom, or the kind of person who could sleep anywhere, don't let this review dissuade you from staying here - but if you're the kind of person who wants/needs a comfortable bed to sleep in at night (and if there are enough of you to fill the other rooms), I would think twice. The beds here are.. kind of a serious issue. I am very sorry, James and Linda, but it's true."

The house is charming, secure and quiet --  it reminded me of a more traditional B&B, which was a nice surprise. This was an ideal spot to rest our heads between family goings-on.  Parking was a breeze, too. "

We were celebrating my daughter's 21st and only came an hour away so we brought tons of food. We were shocked with the amount of food, snacks and beverages that Bev supplied. She was there when we checked in and showed us all around the property. The kids UBER'd in and out of the LoDo area both day and night and it was around $5 a trip. Great area in the backyard for smoking if needed. I would highly recommend to large families or any group. Also highly recommend Genna Rae's Wings and more around the corner. Best chicken wings we ever had."

Rob is full of helpful advice if you're new to the city and went out of his way to make sure we had a great stay. He really does make you feel right at home while still respecting privacy and leaving plenty of space for relaxing.

This place was absolutely everything you could hope for - right down the street from the Denver zoo and science museum, great restaurants nearby,  and still one of the lowest priced airBnBs in the city!"

However, there were some issues, particularly related to cleanliness of the bathroom (something mentioned by a few other reviewers) and some elements of the backyard not lining up with the photos.

There was a slight hiccup at check-in that was resolved within an hour.  Overall, it was a great place for my husband and 2 kids for an entire week in Denver."
3068,192430,2062585,2012-08-22,2005501,Lori,"My husband and I stayed at Kate's for 4 nights. This was our first airbnb experience and we were not disappointed. Kate's home was tidy and comfortable, and Kate made us feel very welcome (as did her sweet cat). We would definitely stay with Kate again if we return to Denver."

We had a few questions when we arrived which Julie answered right away.  Nice view of downtown. We really enjoyed our stay and may come back again! 
Thanks for everything!"
12455,1733052,62961426,2016-02-18,44290933,David,"Great place for a couple or small group.  Basement suite is very comfortable and clean. Entry access is easy and Jason had GREAT communication skills.  Jason even offered to park my car in front of his garage, but street parking was easy and ended up parking my car a block away. Plenty of breweries close to the house and at walking distance. Jason's wife recommend going to a GREAT coffee place called Caffe Sanora's CO 40, it was awesome!"

Highly recommended!"
79974,12901712,306444595,2018-08-12,34871991,Jack,"John and Mimi are awesome! They gave us tons of good suggestions and their place is so nice. It was especially convenient for us because we were taking a bus to Red Rocks and it picked up only a few blocks away. 

The space was extremely comfortable and clean. It was really nice to have a bathroom and shower connected to the room. The bed was extremely comfortable and it was really nice to have a big TV with cable in the room. We also loved spending time on the rooftop. 

I am still having dreams about the breakfast John made us. It was probably the best home-cooked breakfast that I have ever had in my life. 

I will be recommending their place to any of my friends traveling to Denver. We will definitely be staying with them when we come back!"

225984,31714648,522773198,2019-09-02,9106597,Emily,"Cute place and a nice host. However, the outdoor area is swarming with bees. This needs to be fixed before the host offers to include the outdoor space as part of the fee for paying to stay here. Other than that, the place was cute and comfortable and perfectly fine to get cozy for a couple days."

My fiance and I were there for her surgery, and we spent two weeks there. It's a very comfy spot, and a great location just minutes from just about anything. Very comfortable bed and nice appliances like the oven and washer/dryer. Cozy back yard area as well.
We enjoyed our stay very much =]"

22110,3562277,17773477,2014-08-17,6507096,John,"Michelle and her family are just great hosts, fun, interesting, kind, and respectful. The house is perfectly located, close to Denver and local shopping/restaurants, yet in a beautiful quiet neighborhood. The Japanese garden in the evening is about as tranquil a setting as you could find. I could go on for pages, but the short synopsis is, if you're going to Denver and don't want/need to stay downtown, you can't go wrong staying here!"
106953,15644895,144811393,2017-04-16,101872334,Holly,The property looks professionally decorated with a eye for detail. The sheets were crisp and fresh smelling. The accommodations were very comfortable and conveniently located in an area with good eating and shopping. The one disappointment was the missing window treatment in the smaller bedroom that seemingly someone forgot to reinstall. We had to jerry rig a covering using a sheet to block out incoming sunlight.

She was very available on the few occasions I needed her but I had plenty of privacy during my stay. The room was absolutely lovely, with every bit of the space arranged efficiently and set up to welcome guests with thorough labeling (like for the Wi-Fi password), helpful information, toiletry samples, and all kinds of wonderful little things. The location was great, close to bus routes, a lovely trail, and the gorgeous DU campus and just a short walk from restaurants and stores. Barbara and her family are exceptionally friendly, and I felt right at home during my stay with them."

96206,14422394,177651054,2017-08-03,9092739,Dj,"Red brick home right around the corner from a lot of fun Denver action, but you should know that it's best only for smokers and people who can tolerate smoke. The house rules say smoking is allowed in restricted areas, but it's all over the house. If you're a smoker or don't mind smoke, go for it. Judith is a terrific person and very accommodating."

The space is very cute and clean, and garden is lovely. I felt like I was staying in Mrs. Madrigal's community from Tales of the City! The bed was VERY comfortable, and we slept like babies.

I also loved the neighborhood. There are lots of cute shops, restaurants and bars within walking distance. I wish we could have stayed longer!"

Parking was a bit of an issue, there was no parking on the street the entire time we were there, but that wasn’t her fault. We had an amazing time and loved the apartment and its location! Would definitely recommend :)"
172543,22795235,566224000,2019-11-18,73864492,Renae,I cannot recommend Michael and Charlotte's place enough! The beds were so comfortable and the space had everything we needed for a weekend. We were a group of 4 plus one infant and we had plenty of space. They supplied our friends with a diaper changing pad and pack n play which was so helpful. Michael and Charlotte were excellent communicators and we would definitely stay again!

13764,1911814,42656170,2015-08-15,23874007,Lonny,"Our daughter used the unit throughout the summer as she was working in Denver.   The unit is in a great location..quite, safe neighborhood and easy access to everything.

The unit itself is nicely laid out with a nice kitchen with newer appliances and stocked with everything you need.  The bedroom is great with a spacious closet and a really comfortable bed.  There is also a good size living area with a big flat screen TV.   And finally the bathroom is nicely appointed and has a great walk in shower.

The hosts Dana and Randy were great to work with and quickly got back to us on any questions.   They give you complete privacy but are also there if you need anything.

Overall this is a wonderful place to stay for either a short or extended stay in Denver."

She was quick to communicate and made sure I could get in even though it was around midnight. The neighborhood has lots of interesting houses and was quiet at night. It was super convenient to be near bus lines that took me where I needed to go in the heart of the city.

My parents absolutely loved the patio out back, we had a nice BBQ with 4 of us. My dad took the cruiser for a spin, and really loved the location and convenience to restaurants. Would def reccomend this cute little apt, what a great value over any hotel in the same range.. Just loved it!"
91816,13828732,171722391,2017-07-18,23149892,Tara,"We had a wonderful time at Amy and Jesse's place.  It was easy to check in as we were just given a code for the door.  We never personally interacted with Amy and Jesse but we always new they were a phone call away.  The apartment is wonderful just as other reviewers have stated. Decorated very nice and spacious.  There are plenty of things for cooking or grilling if you choose to stay in.  There are some basics like olive oil, salt and pepper too. Can't say enough good things.  We also loved that you could walk to Broadway and grab some great coffee or check out the antique shops.  Highly recommend this place if your travel plans bring you to Denver!"

In a metric of price vs experience vs location, this is the best kind of balance one can find - reasonably priced private dwelling, interesting decorations, cable and internet, a nice bathroom and only an 11 minute walk to the convention center."

54384,8566977,65631812,2016-03-15,59521089,Kristen,"We loved this place. I live in Denver and booked this Airbnb for friends who came to town to visit. I had looked through multiple Airbnb listings in the area, but the vibe of the photos/listing for this space felt more warm and bright and welcoming than anything else I'd seen, and it turned out to be as good in real life as it looked online. 

Clean; comfy beds; a great roof deck; and a lovely common area off the kitchen/between the bedrooms. The location is terrific, walking distance from Wash Park and the shops & restaurants on South Broadway. Corie, the host, made checking in/out and connecting to WiFi etc as easy as pie. She was available to answer any questions we had, and also gave us all the privacy we desired. 

I highly recommend this space if you're looking for a place to stay in Denver in a great neighborhood that gives you a good feel for the city."

It was a great mix of being close to Union Station area (~20 min walk) and being close to several little parks.  We were able to walk to the Safeway and found an AWESOME little bar called Avanti about a 5-10 minute walk from the place.  The unit was spotless and the check-in process was a breeze.  We were so lucky to have found her spot and we highly recommend staying here!

We also experienced several questionable people in the building that made it feel a bit unsafe, although nothing happened.  Construction noise was a bit of a problem.  It was very convenient to union station. I would likely not stay here again, but it was serviceable."
111327,16065774,175329856,2017-07-28,38196838,Adrian,Exactly as described. The bed is comfy and they are very accommodating. Would definitely stay here again.

224318,31398949,539094556,2019-09-30,169751557,David,"We were pleasantly surprised after reading reviews about the place being ""bare bones"" we thought we had everything we needed for a three night stay (with the exception of a coffee maker which would be a great added touch).   You cannot beat this location - walkable to all of central Denver but in a quiet, safe and nice part of town.   Parking was a big plus and check in instructions were spot on and easy."

233294,33704620,540481571,2019-10-03,194556514,Nicole,We stayed one night at Matt’s place before we headed to the airport the next day. Within 10-15 mins from the airport. Super comfy bed. We had everything we needed for our stay. Matt was quick to respond and informative. Would recommend his place to anyone.
9212,923994,19622496,2014-09-15,20367824,John,Rob was a great host.  He had beers in the fridge and coffee and fruit waiting for us upon our arrival.  The house is great.  Stayed nice and cool inside on a couple of pretty warm days outside.  We enjoyed the nice back yard as well as the hot tub.  Location was great too.  Easy walking distance to bars and restaurants and not too far from downtown or Sports Authority Field.

156899,21242663,431720000,2019-04-01,49711107,Adam,Sabrina and Gary were excellent hosts. They were very helpful with our son.  They volunteered to leave us a pack n play and a changing table (both of which they set up for us). Place was great. Would definitely go back.
60799,9250245,484329721,2019-07-08,92994287,Julissa,Rob’s place was great. The location was close to many restaurants and bars and just a short ride away if you don’t feel like walking. The size of the space was perfect and just an overall cool apartment. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to all.
219286,30034575,440323798,2019-04-20,60364287,Brooke,Loved the location of Galatea’s place. The apartment building is nice with nice amenities. Galatea and her crew were quick to respond and help out whenever I needed it. The place is nice and well stocked to make your stay comfortable. I stayed here for three months on a travel assignment and would definitely stay here again!!
41951,6869896,45583490,2015-09-04,40388477,Cindy,"What an incredible house and location!  Billy and Julie have created a very comfortable space with a gorgeous backyard to enjoy in the nice Colorado summer weather.  My husband and I really enjoyed the walkability of this neighborhood, especially traveling with our 2 year old son. The park, Nature and Science Museum, zoo, and restaurants were all just minutes away.  The garage space was a great addition as we were able to safely store our bicycles and additional outdoor gear.
All around, a great location and experience.  I highly recommend it to other travelers looking for a prime location in Denver.  "
120935,17155851,177424269,2017-08-02,55593971,Jessie,We loved Mark's place. It was so calm and quiet yet so hip and close to everything we wanted to see. The bed was beyond comfortable and every detail privided for. We would stay here again in a heartbeat and suggest it to anyone coming to the Denver area.
36177,5794938,145512485,2017-04-18,2743672,Katharine,"We absolutely loved our stay at Allen's penthouse condo. Could not have been in a better location, surrounded by restaurants and bars in a super walkable location. We rented a car for one day to go out to red rocks and having the off street parking in the garage was awesome! We loved the amenities in the house. Shower was great, bed was super comfy, great sunlight, and a perfect deck for having a glass of wine after dinner. We have stayed in probably 50 Airbnb's all over the world and this was one of the best! We will be back! "
132884,18778248,206978941,2017-10-27,142983043,Michael,Great location and easy check in.

217461,29651605,486462891,2019-07-12,57142873,Carmenzina,I appreciated the consistency in communicating with us. The photos do not do this place any justice. The home was beautiful and more than comfortable.
94156,14055472,147014955,2017-04-24,68417120,Daniel,"I really can't say enough good things about how your house worked for our group. Able to comfortably fit 14 guys, check. Able to allow us easy access to central Denver, check. Close to skiing, check. Able to allow us late check-in after some travel delays & to stay a bit beyond checkout to better fit our flight schedule, check & check. And that's not even mentioning the unbelievably generous stocking of the fridge & kitchen with drinks, food, snacks, breakfast items, and so much more. We were blown away & that's coming from all 14 guys. I would recommend to anyone going to Denver, regardless of their specific needs. A 5-star review across the board."
9771,1082572,127008922,2017-01-15,109023719,Nicholas,"Great place in a very cute neighborhood of small houses. Parking was easy and we were able to get right on the highway to escape into the mountains, but we could also walk a few blocks to get groceries, go out to eat, shop etc."
60761,9250245,343777302,2018-11-01,192776915,Jeff,This is my third time staying at rob’s place. He’s a great host and has a wonderful place. I work in downtown so it is super convenient. I would stay here many more times
185561,24247962,285457963,2018-07-03,65206785,Kelsey,"David and Brittany's place is such a gem. It was the perfect home base for my fiance and I on our first trip to Denver. The amenities were great and as described and the decor was stylish and charming. Our favorite aspects we're having laundry, (Hidden by Airbnb) chromecast and a full modern kitchen. The neighborhood was incredible too. We loved trying out all the close food options and shops. We'd definitely stay here again!"
197579,26130792,290064352,2018-07-13,19806980,Ellen,"Great location... The RiNo neighborhood has lots of construction going on, but also lots of great places to eat and have a drink. We were able to walk to the Rockies game, Union Station, the Denver Central Market and 16th St. Mall. From the Mall, it's easy to jump on the free bus and take it to many museums and other other interesting areas. The continental breakfast that's included was perfect for us...scones, muffins, Kind bars, kombucha, yogurt, juices, coffee, tea and we enjoyed being able to eat it outside on the porch. We used the comfortable common area to hang our with our son for while we waited for others to meet us for dinner."
124895,17592456,335968445,2018-10-13,4375979,Meli,"Brianna and Cory’s place is just what you need in Denver! The location is great, a lot of really cool places to eat and do shopping, and super convenient if you are planing on hiking around. The house is super stylish, with a  really good energy and cozy. The level of hospitality was outstanding, which I really appreciated as a solo traveler. They will make you feel at home in no time!"

232686,33557673,558201388,2019-11-02,70007952,Erin,What a cozy perfect little house! It had everything we needed and then some! We were there during a snow storm and Daniel shoveled everything path from the house to the street probably 20 times! The house stayed really warm despite the freezing temps and was surprisingly sound proof. Location was central and easy to get anywhere. Also great communication from Daniel! We would come back again without hesitation!
236782,34751139,466948304,2019-06-09,127767399,Gregory,perfect place for a short getaway. easy in and out street parking. one of the better airbnb’s i’ve ever stayed at.

131297,18535441,483756710,2019-07-07,168532167,Taylar,"Patrick's place is exactly what we were looking for during our long weekend stay in Denver! Walking distance to many great breweries and restaurants and a quick Uber to many of the other neighborhoods in Denver. Having two and half baths for two couples was perfect, and each room is exactly the same. We also really enjoyed the upstairs patio. Would definitely recommend and stay again."
205948,27554725,461537388,2019-05-31,48980157,{MJ} Manjhunath,"This was my first time visiting Denver, Jeremiah’s place was perfect close to downtown. Right opposite his place is the bus station if you are into public transport. He as a person is very friendly, articulate, stories and have amazing hobbies to share. Highly recommend you to consider your stay with him. Specially kudos to all the food he left for grabs and fully equipped kitchen."

The bed and furniture were very comfortable.  Everything we needed to make simple meals was available. We also appreciated the dishwasher and washer and dryer.  

Julia was helpful and communicative. She was flexible and easy to work with when an additional night was needed. I highly recommend this home and Julia as a host."

The room was clean and comfortable, and I slept very well every night. The bathroom was well maintained, and having clean towels and all the toiletries is a plus. Definitely a nice place to stay for those who visit Denver!"
217409,29651515,512736119,2019-08-18,203329313,Brady,"We were a group of 10 college aged guys coming out to Denver for a concert. Great house just 10 minutes from downtown. We mostly used the house for sleeping and weren’t there at all during the day. With that being said, some small upkeep is needed in the backyard to really maximize the space the property has. Other than that it was a perfect place to crash after a long day of hiking or exploring the city."

If you’re looking to get out to Denver, for the city and the mountains, this is the perfect place. You can see both from the roof! Leah also gave great recommendations for local activities/eats. We plan on coming back next year!!"

239750,36235699,534466654,2019-09-22,64022239,Jacki,"Red door was a fantastic location. Plenty of restaurants/dispensaries/etc. within walking distance. Very close to Tejon st/little man ice cream and other pocket neighborhoods within walking distance. We walked to Coors Field with no problem. Coming back from downtown IS all uphill - and we had an absolute BLAST riding around on scooters to avoid it a few times! The driveway is a huge perk, as it is a densely populated city area. Nothing to do with the house - but drive slow and careful in the neighborhood. Visibility isn’t great with parked cars and confusing 2-way and 4-way stop signs. But this North-Easterner found all of the drivers very accommodating and understanding :) 

The backyard was great for morning coffee and a nite cap. We met one of the other guests and had a great time hanging out with him for a little bit."
78093,12649682,174398635,2017-07-25,38975465,Alexandria,"Maren and Diego's place for the perfect spot in Denver. I could not have asked for a better Airbnb. The place for easy to find, in a great location and the house, was better than the pictures! Maren and Diego made me feel at home, even though I only saw them a couple of times. I highly recommend this place to anyone staying in the Denver area."

233967,33877623,460229882,2019-05-28,6016219,Jonathan,"Sunny, artistic, and relaxing space.  The owners' professions in the fine arts are evident in the variety and uniqueness of materials and wall adornments, such as the stone slab kitchen countertops and the neon sculpture in the master bedroom.  Don and Daisy are lovely hosts, and we can't wait until our return stay!"

We walked just down the road one morning to a great breakfast place. The beds/pillows/bedding were extremely comfortable and the shower was very nice as well. The place was so full of character and made for a fun stay. We loved it!"

The space is very clean with all the things you need for a pleasant stay. The location is phenomenal. Seems like a very nice and safe area.

16336,2257217,178068197,2017-08-04,142154058,Brandon,"The room had adequate space and was secluded from the rest of the house with a back entrance for late night returns. The bed was slightly short for me as a 6'2"" man but not uncomfortably so. Comfort wise it was a solid B. Keep in mind there are no private spaces outside the bedroom and the shower bathroom is upstairs and shared with the family (there is a downstairs bathroom that does not have a shower). However the hosts were very friendly and inviting, and seem to take a genuine interest in people. If I return to Denver I'll definitely consider staying there again."

216440,29461706,428107638,2019-03-24,91838503,Naveed,The Baxter Estate was the perfect spot for our trip! We had a big group and there was plenty of room and the location was excellent! Ashley was also a huge help and had tons of suggestions! Highly recommend

171922,22727793,243091425,2018-03-14,111624871,Karlin,"I had a great time in this upscale hostel. Bunks were comfortable, clean and private. The house was uniquely arranged with plenty of comfortable social spaces and little nooks for more private habitation. The 24 hour self serve coffee and espresso bar is a great touch and the numerous food delivery and near by dine out options made for a very enjoyable stay. My  favorite moments were spent outside by the fire place visiting with people from all over the world. I'll be visiting again soon."

68287,10494162,74575119,2016-05-15,45175085,Steph,"Wes's guest house was our favorite AirBNB so far! The location was great (just a mile walk from virtually anything or a $5 Uber fare). The space was exactly as pictured and described, there was also shampoo, conditioner and lotion provided as well as a few different coffees. The guest house sits behind the host's own home so we had a handful of pleasant interactions with the host and his big dogs- which were big sweethearts. The host was very accommodating with arrival and departure, our flight came and left later at night so it was great to be able to work with him around the odd times. We loved staying in Wes's guest house and hope to stay again!"
29127,4471201,89933788,2016-07-30,63598374,Andy,"The farmhouse is in a great location with a very walkable neighborhood.   10 minutes to down town, 30 to the mountains. 

The house is 100+ years old and is very comfortable, but the floors are worn, a few window panes are cracked, and there are not as many electrical outlets as you'd expect in a newer house.  That said, it kept me warm and dry during some crazy spring storms, and with a box fan in the window, I was comfortable sleeping even on the hottest of summer days. 

Dog park within walking distance and a great fenced in yard. It made it possible to bring my fur-kids with me during the 90 day stay. (May-July)

It felt like home as I packed up to leave. "
89867,13748244,442912393,2019-04-24,57514247,Yayoi,"Cute space in a great neighborhood, close to grocery stores, restaurants, parks, and public transit. All the amenities you need for an extended stay in Denver."
50252,7931953,488070580,2019-07-14,3322908,Sam,"An older home in a nice neighborhood. Don’t expect modern comforts (ie central a/c, comfortable furniture, parking). Large common spaces with a kitchen that has all you’d need. Owner lives on site which prevents use of backyard and requires extra diligence with noise."

37500,5990927,319208476,2018-09-05,53474541,Abby,"The location of this adorable, historic apartment is incredible! You have access to the whole city within a few blocks. There are countless breweries and restaurants to try. I recommend getting the Denver Culture Pass or City Pass to see some cool art or see the botanical gardens for a very reasonable price. 

Roger was very communicative and check-in/check-out process was simple. There were even some snacks provided for the weary traveler! I'm so glad we chose this place!"

225380,31569131,435874185,2019-04-11,252447535,Liv,"The location of this was EXCELLENT! I was there for a business trip and was able to walk safely to the convention center as well as... pretty much everywhere. It’s conveniently located close to downtown, but just enough outside of it. Also great food and beverage options on the same block. The space itself was great, I need to buy that mattress for my house. The room was very clean and comfortable, along with a private bathroom."
2085,90307,1736979,2012-07-17,1338506,Tracy,I Had a wonderful stay at Doreen's.   Everything was very comfortable and clean and it was in a nice neighborhood right near the park and zoo.  I would definitely stay here again!

196356,25918224,470051961,2019-06-15,89593047,Katie,"Where to begin? Natasha’s place was even cuter and more comfy in person than my perception from the pictures. We were able to come and go so conveniently with a separate entrance and easy key code for the door. Street parking was super easy and the location was perfect: not too close to the action to be noisy and crowded, but an easy walk to RiNo, five points, Coors field, etc. The beds were really comfy, the shower was AMAZING. Just a really comfortable stay overall. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Natasha!"
75298,12068403,203864098,2017-10-15,75007799,Josh,Place was amazing and in the perfect spot. Extremely walkable to so many awesome places.
133799,18891531,505767994,2019-08-09,227461842,Emily,"Our stay at this place was great. This place is super clean and well taken care of. Everything seemed to be brand new. They left a binder with recommendations for food and drinks which I thought was very helpful. It was me and my husband and two big dogs, that’s as much as I would recommend staying there because anyone more than that it would be too tight. We had trouble with our a/c and unfortunately there wasn’t  anything they could do (my husband does heating and air and recommend they call a guy... the hosts were out of town but I know things like that happen and don’t want to hold it against them) they had really quick response, probably with 10-20 min which I thought was very impressive compared to other places I stayed. I highly recommend this place."
25217,4051568,192665228,2017-09-10,24326009,Steven,"LOCATION: Alyssa's place is quite versatile. If you're looking for something quiet and tucked away in a nice neighborhood, this place is what you're looking for. However, it's also an easy 12 minute walk to the LoHi restaurants and bars if you're looking to stay out late. Plus, a quick inexpensive uber ride will get you and your friends to most Denver neighborhoods (including Rino) if you're looking to venture out of Highlands a bit. 

THE PLACE: The house is bigger than it looks in the photos. There's plenty of space in the main living room to put down two air mattresses. I stayed with 6 guests and there was no feeling of crowdedness. Also, the bedrooms are quite tucked away upstairs from the rest of the house. The outdoor space is big enough for you and your guests to hang out comfortably. The hung globe lights were a nice touch. Lastly, the place was really clean upon arrival. It's obviously been recently updated and remodeled but still maintains that ""homey"" feel my guests and I were looking for.

THE HOST: Alyssa was quickly responsive to each and every email. Checking in and out was an absolute breeze. We needed an early check in and she was more than accommodating. I accidentally left a couple of items behind but Alyssa gladly arranged for me to pick them up without any delay. I'd highly recommend this house for any group visiting Denver, regardless of what kind of trip you're looking for. Will gladly stay again."

Mariah is an excellent host, very friendly and accommodating with knowledge of the local area.  She went above and beyond making my stay a pleasurable experience.  I will definitely be back!"
27671,4263714,59984314,2016-01-17,34867488,Vinny,This is a great spot to stay at. The hosts were incredibly flexible and allowed me to check in early. The neighborhood is great too. There's a great little coffee shop nearby and public transit is a shirt walk away.
214658,29261204,534585233,2019-09-22,23050056,Nancy,"If you want an excellent location in LoDo Denver, this is it.  Centrally located to get everywhere downtown - Union Station, Coors Field, Milk Block, the arts district (all walkable distances) RiNo, LoHi and light rail all a short distance away.  You can also hit the highway too to head to Red Rocks or the mountains.  The unit had all the amenities needed including gated parking, a washer /dryer and kitchen utensils /appliances.   Vince was super responsive to all our questions or needs!  Thank you Vince for a super stay.   We hope to be back."

6930,787456,7253624,2013-09-13,1965917,Tammy,"Pamela was an absolutely fantastic host! The place was gorgeous, the suite was very clean (and she had some chocolate and strawberries waiting there for us), and the location was in a beautiful neighborhood. From Market Street Station, it's a 20-minute bus ride on 1 bus, and a block and a half walk. Whole Foods and a number of small shops and restaurants were maybe a mile away, and there were a few places within 10 minutes. The Botanic Gardens begin literally across the street, and she lent us her membership card so we could get in. She was happy to chat and tell us all the good places to see and sample, but aware that we might need alone time too, which is the combination you really want for a host. Couldn't recommend her or her house more!"

99741,14932614,132862257,2017-02-19,70865708,Kevin,"I traveled to Denver to do a bit of hiking nearby and to explore Denver itself.  I liked Joe's place and all of his little touches.

This was my first Airbnb experience and it was definitely a positive one.   Joe's place was clean and had everything I may have needed available.   I liked that the backyard was large and had plenty of seating.   I also liked that the water pressure in the shower was strong, better than that of the vast majority of hotels I've stayed.   As an added bonus, Joe had provided a plethora of breakfast items for us, and had a full set of cooking ware as well as a grill.

Joe himself was friendly and responsive.    I changed my plans on a dime and decided to check out a couple days early and Joe stopped by within an hour of me making that decision to help me check out.   He also agreed to refund me for the remainder of the stay.

The place was ""cozy"", or small, if you will, but it worked for our needs - I didn't feel like we needed to stay somewhere with more space.   If I had to nitpick a couple other things, I'd note that the TV was relatively small, relatively far from the couch and didn't have great sound.   I'd also note that the internet didn't seem very fast.   Neither of these were an issue for me as our use of them was minimal.

I'd recommend his place if you plan on visiting Denver with a friend, being out and about and not only exploring Denver itself, but, also driving around to do some other nearby site-seeing."
4596,662431,116801571,2016-12-03,60134310,Katie,"This place was exactly what we needed for our long weekend in Denver! The studio felt like a luxurious hotel room - comfy bed, great bathroom/shower, excellent amenities. We were extremely pleased with our stay. Perfect for one or two people. Two thumbs up! "
123298,17386946,164233966,2017-06-26,85937398,Bryce,The condos are very quiet with a pool right across the parking lot. It's full of good energy and a chill spot to stay. We saw it as a place to shower and sleep more than a spot to hang around. If there's anything we would have changed it would have been more comfortability in terms of the bed and furniture.
173008,22884861,276112649,2018-06-12,35167831,Alex,"We loved this place; it was stylish, modern and spacious. We felt very much at home, and it was in a great location to walk around and take in some of the more up-and-coming spots in the city. Would definitely stay there again!"

The house was charming and the neighborhood was also very nice.  It was close to everything we wanted to do downtown, but also not too far to go into the mountains for some great Colorado views."

The host should provide a small fan or something in both rooms because it was very hot when we were there.The bathroom is only in one building and you have to walk to the main room in the middle of the night. There’s limited privacy, as there is no curtains in all windows. The host were nice and responsive. The place was clean and had needed amenities. The furniture was fashionable and the design was cute."

I look for cleanliness and safety when searching for homes. Elizabeth's place was very clean and I felt totally safe. The kitchenette had new appliances. New carpet throughout. 

Communication with Elizabeth was great and all the information we needed was available in writing.   I would definitely stay at Elizabeth's place again"

Always had parking on the side of the street. Only $8-$13 to Downtown Denver via Lyft. Close to some little markets. Owners answered all of my questions. And they had all the essentials. Super cozy bed too. Would stay here again!

161833,21725586,500828587,2019-08-02,253282811,Carlee,Nice area close to downtown! Highly suggest renting a car to get around and to do stuff outside the Denver area.

Fantastic location (the light rail is just down the street, and interstate access is simple and close), comfortable home with all the amenities you need on travel!  Cash and his family were incredibly kind hosts who showed us around and made us feel at home.  The neighborhood is safe, walkable and in close proximity to many other great neighborhoods and sites.  I suggest this property to anyone needing a great place to stay in Denver!"
194545,25486771,416624200,2019-02-24,49658913,Maxim,"Good place. Only half bathroom, so don't expect to shower."

4539,632709,552911374,2019-10-22,26100692,Michael,Perfect spot for two couples and their pooch! Lots of great coffee shops made morning walks a delight. The neighborhood is beautiful with a great mix of old (small) houses and new (huge) houses with a lot of character. Restaurants are close from fancy-pants dining like Avanti to classic local Chubby's (slinging burritos since 1967). Great bars from dicey to chi-chi. The house itself is set up great with a nice back yard and a large kitchen and dining room. The bedrooms are upstairs and quiet so people can sleep and other people can hang out. Street parking was easy to find. All in all a great deal in a great city. Highly recommended.
206502,27662226,529343246,2019-09-14,3015301,Francesco,"Everything as described, position is perfect, just 15 minutes walking from downtown and very close to light rail. I also appreciated the door keypad so that you don't need to carry (and risk to lose) a key. Very fast wifi"

This apt is close to light rail transit and right around the corner from a great grocery, Sprouts. The location is also close to Washington Park, a running, walking and biking mecca.  Recommended!"
221523,30739889,425234785,2019-03-17,246654027,Denise,Great place!
14770,2104774,70101315,2016-04-16,43178094,Greg,"The place was in a fantastic location, only steps away from numerous dining venues, shopping and pubs. Plus, it's only a moment's drive to parks, museums, grocery stores and downtown Denver. We could not have asked for a better location. 

For the apartment itself, it has private parking, which was a HUGE convenience. The other tenants were very quiet and we never really saw them. The washer and dryer are located in the basement and are communal, so you have to leave the building and enter through a side door if you're planning on washing clothes. Also, bring quarters, as it's a pay-per-use machine. 

The apartment itself has some age to it and is pretty small, but cozy. It's clean and some improvements have been made to it, which help offset the age of the building. I would not recommend this space for more than two people as space is limited. There's cable tv and Internet access, so that was nice to have in the evening. The living room also has a large skylight, which really brightens up the place. Jeanne has a book of local restaurants and stuff to do, so that was very helpful. 

Jeanne's husband was on the property making repairs/upgrades to one of the units while we were there. We didn't hear anything work being done, but he made sure to speak to us and see that we had everything we needed. He also had great travel advice regarding the best routes to the airport and what-not. 

In short, I would stay there again for sure."
229049,32467080,443331924,2019-04-25,64420952,Olivia,The space was very clean and thoughtfully designed with windows near the ceiling so it feels very private and open. Street parking is free and easy.
163357,21811514,404604796,2019-01-24,233158125,Michael,"Michelle made our first stay in Denver simply amazing. Her taste in activities, bars and restaurant recommendations where right on par with what we had planned on doing. Super cozy home equipped with everything you’ll need for a comfortable stay. Would HIGHLY recommend. Thanks so much Michelle."
239453,36075162,511639672,2019-08-17,16438578,Erica,"Absolutely gorgeous space; I loved the decor, so many cute touches! The backyard space was beautiful, and the location was perfect, within 10 minute walk of multiple restaurants, breweries, and coffee shops!"
238461,35606018,556520945,2019-10-29,47076726,Jon,"We were in town for a conference, and stayed at Dyami's place near Sloan Lake. It was perfect for a short drive to the convention center (though longer with the snowstorm that hit). Regardless, check in was easy, the space was large with plenty of room and multiple beds. The space was clean and bathroom spotless. Dyami was great with communication and helping us out with whatever problems we happened to run into on our trip. Would highly recommend a stay here!"

40762,6515185,169227306,2017-07-11,133655807,Mario,"The location is perfect for getting to any part of downtown and to Union Station. We didn't have a car our first two days and it wasn't an issue at all as there was so much to do and see in Downtown Denver. The high end bathroom was a huge plus with its double shower heads, pebble shower floor and Kohler sink fixture. The bed was very comfortable as well and everything was clean and well kept. I highly recommend this airbnb and I hope to stay there again some day!"
16487,2257217,337576894,2018-10-16,29539546,Martha,Great location and as described - the room is small but very comfortable. Coffee and bagels and even homemade muffins. I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend for a short trip to Denver.
238626,35683144,555413588,2019-10-27,14259504,Julien,"Très jolie dépendance d’une belle maison victorienne. Bien que nous ayons peu vu Tom, il était très sympathique. L’endroit était accueillant, propre, bien décoré et équipé, et dans un quartier calme mais à 2 pas de nombreux coffee shops, bars et lieux tendance. L’accès par l’allée n’est pas évident à trouver mais il permet de garer un véhicule et d’accéder à la petite maison de manière indépendante.
Un bon choix pour découvrir Denver"
149016,20760081,256433908,2018-04-22,70276243,Mitch,Great spot with easy 25 minute walk or 5 minute Uber to Denver’s Union Station or Coors Field. Apartment comfortable enough for 4 adults with a well equipped kitchen & good sized bathroom.
36163,5794938,130697871,2017-02-07,14551412,Amanda,"Allan's place was amazing! It's located in a central area, near many restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. We were able to walk to most places from the loft. The free parking was invaluable too. The loft itself was very clean and had many amenities, including a washer and dryer and full kitchen. Allan even included free chocolate and wine! I'd highly recommend this loft if you are staying in Denver."
139266,19503543,426360876,2019-03-20,238577651,Simon,Great place to catch up with old friends for a few days. Kinga is fantastic with communication. We enjoyed a few spots in the neighborhood and it was super easy to catch a Lyft when we were venturing out around town.
138637,19441412,348078293,2018-11-12,191961037,Chris,"Place was awesome! Very modern and trendy, centrally located and spacious. We had a snow day and the view did not disappoint (you could even see the mountains on a clear day). Sheik was able to accommodate our early check-in, which was amazing. Chromecast was also a bonus.

105441,15507830,164281238,2017-06-26,88746469,Katherine,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and we were very impressed.  The location is a short drive from many attractions in Denver. We had a two year old with us, so it's notable to say that Bob's house is a short walk to a very nice park with an extensive playground. As for the apartment itself, it had all the amenities you could ever need including plush towels, toiletries (even makeup removal wipes!), and extra blankets/pillows. He even left a gift basket in the refrigerator for us, which is a very kind gesture. Also, access to the washer/dryer is a HUGE plus. You get your own parking spot and the neighborhood itself is quiet. Bob was easily accessible, accommodating, and very friendly. We look forward to staying again next time we are in Denver!"

I absolutely loved the fact of having a keyless entry, a safe, gated, place to park, being in a centralized location to the night life, and added security with the adorable courtyard. Added bonus, there is a cute restaurant connected to the lofts! I would definitely recommend Jessica and Jess as they were also very responsive to any questions I had while staying at their place. "

Everything was very clean and organized from the kitchen to the bathrooms, to the sheets and towels. The location was perfect and close to major highways. Street parking was super easy every night we were there. I would definitely recommend Matt's place to stay. We even extended our trip and decided to stay at his place. Matt was available to help with anything we needed at any time and always responded to me promptly. Thank you, Matt!"

The location was walking distance to a lot of restaurants the Capitol and a cheap Uber/Lyft ride to other parts of town. Since Jason was out of town, we communicated with Cate who was quick to respond. As others have stated, parking is difficult in that area (which is no fault of the host), so we would recommend using Uber/Lyft to get around. We would definitely stay there again!"

I do highly recommend these owners and anything they have to rent because it will be top notch!

213991,29130386,465907490,2019-06-08,83571474,Liv,"This is a very nice space that's very clean and perfect for couples. We wanted to cook our own breakfasts and make snacks and were pleased to fine basic cooking supplies when we needed them. My husband and I live in California currently and wanted to visit Denver because we considered moving there. After our stay we decided we love the city and will be relocating soon. Stetson and Megan kindly provided us with suggestions for areas we should check out to give us a sense of the city. The time we stayed there was quite hot but even though the room is on the second floor, we had no trouble keeping the place cool. We also didn't have to drive far to get around. We didn't get a chance to explore the location by walking, but I found I was happy to have a rental car during our time, mostly because of the heat. Overall we had a great time and would recommend individuals and couples to stay here."

210585,28416784,444960163,2019-04-28,116739772,Jeffrey,"This apartment is one of the best I’ve experienced using Airbnb. It is stylish, spacious, clean, comfortable (the bed is perfect), and uniquely situated in a very nice area of downtown Denver. Within a block, there’s a free (!) bus that will bring you anywhere along 16th street, much of which is blocked off as a vibrant pedestrian mall. Amazing restaurants within blocks - and a couple even on the ground floor of the building itself. I enjoyed staying at Jayson’s place and will do so again the next time I’m in Denver."
197130,26062987,419273168,2019-03-03,92853041,Katie,"We had the most relaxing stay in Denver. It was so nice to have a beautiful home with all the amenities near anything and everything you could possibly need! The neighborhood is cute and everyone is incredibly friendly. The check in process was perfect since we just needed codes to access everything. We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood, playing in the snow, cuddling up in the living room, watching movies, cooking in the kitchen, etc. The house has anything you could ever need, especially in the kitchen! It’s only 10-15 minutes from the airport which was so convenient when we had to pick up friends. It’s also a comfortable distance from the city, so we were able to get out and explore when the weather was warmer! Thank you for such a lovely stay, we’ll be back soon for sure!"
85320,13414484,284576509,2018-07-01,117850071,Sara,GREAT space in a great location off of Colfax. We had so much room with the whole floor to ourselves! This was also the perfect spot if you like Voodoo Donuts which was only a 10minute walk away!

79969,12901712,280612334,2018-06-23,7117294,Birgit,"If we could create our perfect hosts, Mimi and John would be the result. They are amazingly nice, welcoming, and helpful. The place is spotless, all necessities and more provided, check-in and communication super easy. Modern room, modern bathroom, better than a hotel. Rooftop deck for hanging out and chatting the night away is a nice plus. 
The coffee: extra 5 stars. John knows all there is to know and more about Espresso, his equipment is top-notch, the dedication to the perfect taste is incredible. For coffee afficionados: there is no better Espresso outside Italy. His French press, the homemade coffee liquor (White Russian on a new level!), are all easily the best we ever had. 
And those guys are so nice! Super friendly, helpful, generous and welcoming, making our stay in Denver an unforgettable one. We will definitely be back and recommend the room 100%. 
Oh, and Bitsy is a sweety :) "

A lovely little pond out the back and a really comfortable basement apartment with it's own seperate entrance from the back of the property. Really convienient to shopping etc as well.  Its a lovely neighbourhood and Candace was super helpful and friendly. 

It is a basement so the ceilings are on the lowish side and you can hear footsteps above sometimes - it was no issue for me at all - but if you are super senstitive or really tall you might want to consder that. 

The bath is a lovely  claw foot with a shower over it so not fort everyone - I loved it!

Lock box entry was really helpful too."

When we came back after it had been ""cleaned,"" the sheets were still dirty and smelled like weed, there were urine stains on the bathroom wall, and paper towels taped over the window. There were only two (not very clean) towels in the bathroom even though we had 4 guests and random half-used bath products all around the tub. It was gross. "

He's 2-3 blocks from Bcycle stations which I took advantage of my entire trip, but hes also only a few blocks from Rino district, a few blocks north of Colfax (where a ton of things are), not to far from city park (quick bike ride), close to downtown and Larimar square, and his greater neighborhood is so pleasant. The room has it's own ac unit so you can control the temp, he has some coffee (Keurig) and tea in kitchen for guests. I appreciated being able to use the laundry room to wash some clothes while there, and his roommate Calico is also very helpful and nice. He was away for most of my stay but I got to meet him as I was leaving, and he shared a number of places I'd enjoy on my next trip..he has a lot of recommendations and is pretty communicative through the app. Entire home is clean, they provide guests with mini toiletries and access in coming and going was simple and seamless.

The space was clean and orderly, and had  just enough of everything for my fiancé and I for the two nights we stayed there. They have a sweet Golden Retriever named Manny that wanted nothing more than to be pet and loved. He was cute and wanted us to stay and play so he laid in front of the door when it was time for us to leave! I definitely recommend this  place if you’re looking for just a couple nights, some good conversation, and some nice views of the mountains from the balcony!"

106971,15644895,182501595,2017-08-14,7550810,Anh,Fantastic place for a short visit to Denver - central and close to good restaurants. Check-in process was easy and convenient! Definitely made our trip so efficient! 
206469,27662226,422963734,2019-03-12,239764766,Ciara,Sarah was super nice and helpful. The location was awesome. I was able to Uber and walk places often.
230287,32814056,569562218,2019-11-26,310836029,Shiyue,The host canceled this reservation 130 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
136383,19141160,407621948,2019-02-02,172884433,Stephanie,"What a wonderful spot to stay, with a wonderful host. We got everywhere we need to go quickly, because of the location. Everything was clean, quiet and comfortable. I definitely hope to stay there again next time we're in Denver."
175556,23162597,543462326,2019-10-07,4923289,Chrissy,Great stay! Fit our family of 10 perfectly. Super comfortable and clean!
125211,17623101,279777454,2018-06-21,20522046,Jeremy,Great place. Walkable to tons of restaurants and some of the best coffee I’ve had at Allegro. Very safe neighborhood. Stylish space with nice little touches like an iPhone charger provided on both sides of the master bed. Beds were very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again!
13753,1911814,25182557,2015-01-08,17604630,Patrick,"Absolutely fantastic! The place is spacious, clean, and well furnished. It's in a great area of Denver, close to plenty of good restaurants and bars, and it's just a short drive to the downtown area. Randy and Dana were gracious hosts and just great folks in general. Couldn't have asked for a better stay!"
82781,13078248,345304453,2018-11-04,45098584,Judith,A lovely home in a great location! Would definitely recommend for your stay in Denver!
106058,15536986,256393279,2018-04-22,138171492,George,Renee and Miquel were awesome. The area is awesome with great restaurants near by and was close to everything we wanted to do. Hope to stay there again next year.
59570,9135545,439254171,2019-04-18,13651590,Thomas,Sarah is fantastic. Great value for the location
243456,38291831,534485823,2019-09-22,71119828,Raynell,This was the most amazing Airbnb I’ve ever been to. The host was a great communicator and made it so simple and the amenities were great. We felt like we were at a friends house. The apartment building has this amazing pool and hang out top area and a gym. I would give it 10 stars out of five.
222695,31039806,472885713,2019-06-20,15297007,Monique,"Overall, my stay here was good. The location was fantastic and I had great access to basically everything I needed. Metro-rail is right around the corner for public transportation and Lyft's are readily available (pick-up within 2 min). The apartment is dark at night as most of the lamps in the space didn't work. The bathroom light was also out which made it a bit dim. Wifi is also spotty in the bedroom but works just fine in the living room area. The space basically had all the amenities you'd expect in a ""hotel room"" (except central air/AC) and it was clean and ready to go when I needed to check-in. Rene doesn't really communicate at all during your stay but was responsive enough when I had questions prior to my arrival (albeit, a bit slow). Overall I would definitely recommend. Great location and clean...a good place to stay if you plan on spending most of your time exploring Denver."
98371,14759489,561528511,2019-11-09,299079618,Weixiang,My first Airbnb experience. It’s great!
33478,5334219,136962263,2017-03-12,6484043,Rebecca,"We have had a good experience with Airbnb places generally, but this is the first time the place was way BETTER than I expected from the pictures!  The place is a duplex in a super cute and hip neighborhood (Highlands).  Many nice restaurants and shops within walking distance.  Communication with Susan was very quick and easy.  Getting into flat was very easy.  The place is stylishly decorated -- in modern furniture and extremely clean and tidy.  Lots of nice touches (bathrobes, books about Denver, nice bedding, a binder with tips on what to do locally). There are two bedrooms with comfortable queen beds, a large well-equipped kitchen, comfortable sitting room with dining table, and an office area.  We came in the winter and did not use it, but there is an AC, which I think would be a plus for the summer.  We really liked this place a lot -- an excellent choice and highly recommended!!!"
129340,18304991,543863796,2019-10-08,131085300,Matt,"If your'e taking an uber around town, this is the place to stay if your interests are located in downtown Denver.  The room was cozy, well appointed, and practical. When I come back, I will definitely shoot for this place again."
75991,12186872,500810856,2019-08-02,202069855,Tracy,"The place is a bit small and is above a garage, but is good for a short stay. The place was clean as well. I would stay here again if passing through Denver."
108730,15807058,256432101,2018-04-22,52710427,Melissa,"Amanda was a great host and very easy to get in touch with.  Would totally stay here again.  The condo was very clean and perfect for two people.  Loved how close it was to some great bars and restaurants; we walked to almost all our meals. Definitely recommend Patxi's for pizza, Olive & Finch for amazing sandwiches and Waffle Brothers. Having a parking spot was perfect as trying to find on the street would have been challenging.  Overall, would totally recommend."
144529,20227444,464074831,2019-06-04,111637335,Kelly,"The place was a good size and had everything we needed! When I had questions about check in, Ven was quick to answer the phone and actually came out to help me and then gave me a tour of the place. The location was awesome, about 8-10 min drive or $8 lyft ride from LoDo. Also, easy parking spaces on the street out front. I would definitely stay again!"
213703,29063041,366513012,2019-01-02,155801670,Katie,Very quaint place in a great location! We had everything we needed and enjoyed our stay!
753,592,2789114,2012-11-02,3992995,Charma,"Jill, and her stand-in host Carla, were wonderful ! Easy going, helpful, friendly, respectful of privacy needs, warm and generous with food, directions, jokes, stories, and tips about town.  I highly recommend Jill."

224898,31514726,566798437,2019-11-20,179272801,Moe,Great place to stay! Will stay here again in the future!
206859,27734054,428997114,2019-03-26,246165685,Jake,Richards place was great! The fridge having water bottles and snacks was a great touch and everything was spotless when we arrived. All of the kitchen appliances are new and great if you want to cook a meal. The large TV is great to watch movies on and it’s in a great location. Less than 30 min to anywhere in Denver and the airport. Richard was also very prompt with his responses if we needed anything or had questions. We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Denver.
64115,9710417,96554155,2016-08-23,76257767,Brittnee,Anna's place is absolutely perfect. We had such a wonderful time staying at her little getaway. We will definitely be staying there again when we travel to Colorado. The location was PERFECT. Next to everything we could have possibly wanted to do and the space within the cottage was more than enough. 
5439,665622,228643444,2018-01-20,165076848,Peter,"Becky was AMAZING. Great experience and when I come back I’m definitely staying here again. Clean and easy access, VERY walkable as titled. Close to great spots and everything around you. Everything you need for a great stay was provided, let’s you really feel like you live in Denver."
46952,7592378,197197646,2017-09-24,8440500,Kenneth,"The Carriage House was fantastic.  When we arrived the place was very clean, and was exactly as nice as it looks in the pictures.  The location was convenient for us, and we enjoyed the restaurant recommendations that were provided.  Thanks!"
135528,19100541,483733041,2019-07-07,227201648,Lara,"Great location, great hosts, the house was clean and ready to go. Owners are easy to communicate with if needed.  Highly recommend staying at this location. Enjoy!"
231401,33251110,504981532,2019-08-08,82889897,Alisa,Nice room and comfortable bed. Karen and her husband are really nice and gave us advices for our traveling.
93222,13972526,368948734,2019-01-08,158352422,Lauren,"Karina's place had everything we needed, from toiletries to food. A nice view of the mountains, clean, overall a great place to stay in Colorado!"
78914,12799600,318521585,2018-09-03,95913959,Jamie,Great clean place.  Good location.
226454,31805436,544287960,2019-10-09,59943956,Therese,"This was a convenient location for all of the downtown Denver sightseeing and bar hopping we planned to do. After a whole day of hiking, the shower had some great, hot water pressure. Overall, this would be a great place for someone to stay who is looking for a place to crash while exploring the city.
It may be more appropriate to list this Airbnb as an extra room rather than an independent space, as the sound carries very well from the rest of the house. While the experience wasn't at all bad, my partner and I felt self conscious of making too much noise since we could hear the sounds of the rest of the house so clearly."
128824,18250654,450165411,2019-05-08,84317553,Melissa,"Zachary was a great host! He and Ebone had lots of good suggestions of things to do in the Denver area, and they were responsive and easily accessible. The apartment complex is a short walk to the city center. The room is as described, and the bathroom is private."

192139,25195731,272543732,2018-06-03,95033839,Kyle,"This is a great place to stay in downtown Denver! You are in close walking or cheap uber ride distance to so many great spots. 

The house is very nice and recently remodeled. We had a great stay and will definitely be looking to come back to stay at Grandpas house "
5701,676825,77419343,2016-05-31,58056244,Nancy,Krista's home was beautiful and spacious. It was much nicer than the pictures actually portray. We were in Denver for a wedding over a long weekend and found our accommodations perfect for 6 adults and one toddler! I would recommend it highly.
43343,7070674,493512737,2019-07-22,70160086,Jeffrey,"Loved this place!  Everything was great...the layout, the location, communication from McKenzie.  Highly recommend!"
113142,16172759,401716479,2019-01-15,196665250,Michelle,"A coworker and I just stayed at Hannah’s condo for nine day business trip. The condo is easy to find, parking is convenient and check in went smoothly. Upon arrival the space was stylish, really clean, filled with all needed amenities and some great homey touches. After work we walked to local restaurants. I will definitely book again."

67721,10343072,300660605,2018-08-02,55037251,Christine,"Alisons place was easy to get too off of the highway,  very clean and comfortable. Nice location, close to activities, but far enough away that the neighborhood was quiet."
188338,24605701,309794345,2018-08-18,47540369,Sarah,"I've Airbnb-ed a decent number of places, and this one was hands down my favorite. Very unique, comfortable, and private (loved the patio area). Location is safe and convenient-lots of food options down the road- and the host is very communicative while giving you your space. We'll be back!"
53172,8427693,68740420,2016-04-06,6608081,Nicole,"Matt and Vicki were excellent hosts. My boyfriend and I weren't around the house a lot, but they were sure to catch us when we were and welcomed us. They were very easy to communicate with, and their home was very comfortable. The location was great--Sunnyside is a cool neighborhood with a lot of great restaurants nearby, & he very proximal Cherry Bean Café was a super nice and friendly place to go every morning!"

17359,2467260,61489054,2016-02-05,52445717,Rhonda,"Our host was not available to meet us in person, however, he checked in with us to make sure everything was ok.  Ryan responded immediately to my text and was very accomdating.  The 2 bedroom in law apt was very clean and comfortable. I had never used Airbnb before so I was not sure what to expect. The apartment was well equipped, and the neighborhood was very nice."
198765,26253752,296872556,2018-07-26,119905239,Russell,Great place right by the Zoo and the Museum. I had a great time. Super cool.
94041,14042763,460641319,2019-05-29,157320596,Susan,Lynnette’s place had comfort and style and we would definitely stay there again on any return trip to Denver. We were very comfortable and felt right at home. I especially liked how easy it was to use their system to enter and exit their place. Many Airbnb places we have stayed at in the past have had issues with getting keys and finding parking.

7484,833937,90353920,2016-07-31,38770037,Pallavi,"Eliza's home was absolutely wonderful for a weekend in Denver. It was close enough to downtown that Uber was cheap for a group of friends. The house was comfortable for 5 people. The kitchen was well equipped to cook. The backyard was perfect for morning coffee/tea and to hang out. We felt safe inside the home, had no issues with anything and loved the comfort. Eliza was very responsive and provided lots of suggestions and tips for the Denver area. "
47380,7603546,179890377,2017-08-08,7018774,Megan,"As advertised, incredibly central location that's much more affordable than hotels in the neighborhood. Dennis is really friendly, too!"

126512,17989895,523454568,2019-09-03,162700786,Christopher,James’s place was an unexpected treat. The photos were nice but don’t do the unit or neighborhood justice. 5 minute uber from downtown and plenty of places to walk to in the hood. I also used the uber bikes to get around. Full remodeled kitchen and bathroom. The bed is huge and there is plenty of storage space. Would absolutely stay here again!
7989,852934,559798420,2019-11-04,17644885,Melissa,Vivian and Tom's place was very cozy and in a great location. Close to light rail and cheap uber's downtown. Private entrance and own private space. Would recommend their place 100%. Also was a great value.
217858,29706294,366472346,2019-01-02,174104931,Justin,"Great place to stay for friends or family! Home was clean and everything you could imagine was provided on site. Location was perfect; there was a park with lake, as well as a strip mall with grocery and food options within walking distance. Also, perfect spot for getting into the city and exploring everything Denver has to offer.

Definitely would stay here again!"
106391,15583685,258808207,2018-04-29,93360944,Kelsie,Great place! Location is close to downtown which was perfect. House was clean and had everything we needed. Would definitely stay there again.
44531,7247567,58946749,2016-01-05,51097675,Patricia,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it could not have turned out better.  I chose this location initially because of the close proximity to my son's apartment (a tiny apartment that he shares with his girlfriend, a buddy, and a large black lab!) and because staying with him was just not an option.  Lia always responded promptly to my emails and texts and even though my flight didn't get in until after 11 PM, she and Tillman were waiting up to welcome me and offer tea, coffee and a chance to feel comfortable. If I needed anything, they were more than happy to accommodate me.  Their home was so cute, good-sized bedroom with a comfy queen size bed and a clean, private bathroom - also, use of the living room and kitchen.  The neighborhood was great and it was easy to just walk to my son's apartment. Everyone asked if it felt odd to be in someone's home that I had never met, but honestly, it just didn't.  I've already mentioned using Airbnb to others as an option when traveling, but I would also add that if you are heading to Denver, this home may be just what you are looking for.  Thanks for making my first trip to Colorado so pleasant!"
224220,31364596,503223947,2019-08-05,255608904,Chandler,Great Place to Stay if you’re looking to Stay in Downtown Denver!

The location was wonderful and walking distance to some great spots in the Highlands. It was a perfect option for our stay and we will be back!

141224,19751421,556505847,2019-10-29,26583977,Joseph,"Had a great time at Troys place the house was just as pictured. It was clean, close to rent bikes and nice places to eat, we even had private parking in the back of the house so didn't have to worry about parking at night.  Any question we had Troy was quick to respond. Great place to stay."

Allison's home is both gorgeous and comfortable, not to mention in an ideal location. But beyond the creature comforts, Allison was a fabulous host who was always easily available if we had questions or needed something. Thank, again, Allison for a wonderful stay!"
57896,8954951,269588722,2018-05-27,156708826,Beth,"Gorgeous space in a fun, walkable neighborhood! Good to note that the main bedrooms and both showers are on the third floor if stairs are tricky for you. Ena was a gracious and wonderful host. We would absolutely stay here again!"

Great and quiet location near a lake and Tennyson Street, which has a variety of restaurants, shops and brewpubs.  Easy check-in  and communication process."

211550,28634213,359347188,2018-12-16,2186900,Marissa,"Jake has a great spot in a great location! There is a garage too! However, there was NO coffee pot! I improvised but I would rather have had a coffee pot. This is a great place for a group of young men or women that do not mind a lived in cleanliness. It was neat and orderly except in the closets where I was told to look for extra towels. 

There was one bathroom that was overlooked so the toilet had a ring, the shower floor on the edges were dirty, and the floors needed to be mopped. 

When we arrived it had snowed that day and it was COLD! It would have been great if someone had prepared the condo get to a more reasonable temperature for a pleasant arrival. We would have been satisfied with 64-66 degrees. When we arrived it was 58 degrees, we were tired, and the heater fan was hissing a loud noise through the night. 

The fridge had old food that I had to dispose of the contents, and the fridge doors and handles were dirty to the touch which I cleaned.

Older women or moms and grandmas that require CLEAN! This may NOT be your spot especially since a cleaning fee is charged. (Jake was out of the country, and maybe he hired someone to manage things. If he did,  he informed him so he knows it was mediocre.) 

Jake was sweet to deal with and he did work things out with us monetarily which I am grateful."

There was no problem with me using the kitchen and its appliances such as fridge and microwave. I also appreciated being able to do a load of laundry while I was there. My room and attached bath were very private. and well appointed.  The location was ideal. My first couple of days I had no car but this was not a problem because the house is located close (approximately a 10 minute walk) to a light rail station that connects directly to Union Station and the free 16th St shuttle to downtown. Later in the week I rented a car to travel out of town for sightseeing. Since the house is located close to a major highway, getting out of the city in the morning and back in the evening was a breeze. And because there was ample street parking in front of their house returning home after a full day on the road was hassle-free. I hope to return to Denver in the future and will definitely plan to stay here again."

From answering my questions before our Denver stay through saying goodbye on the way to the airport. It was awesome to have friends to ask questions to.  The place was immaculate, put my apartment in NYC to shame! Spotless, working appliances and very comfortable. Great patio out back. GREAT location. Super chill with bars and restaurants in walking distance. "

She had great suggestions. It was a great stay. Even though the home was shared, she was barely home.  There was plenty privacy.. If I'm ever in town again I'd defintely stay at the 420 Zen room."
89824,13746714,220712787,2017-12-23,63741317,Diego,"I stayed at Paul's house for three months in the Fall 2017 and it was a wondeful experience. The house is incredible. It is very ample, fully equipped, and clean, and Paul makes sure that everything works properly. He is a wonderful host, always willing to engage in nice conversation, recommend something to do in Denver or even invite you to do something with him. He is really generous. I happened to spend Thanksgiving at  the house and Paul even organized a dinner for the residents.
Not having a car in Denver may be inconvenient to move around. The house is a 25 minute-walk from a supermarket and a 30-minute walk from light rail stations. That was a little inconvenient for me but I would choose it again because I felt really at home. Hope to be back soon!"

My boyfriend is a vegetarian, and he was very happy there were restaurant options within walking distance. The house had a grill which was a plus, laundry, plenty of cooking utensils and pots and pans, and parking. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of space for four people. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Hannah was quick to respond to any questions and was flexible with our check in/out times. Thanks Hannah for a great stay! "

The property isn't visible from the street, so Edwin met us to take us back, even though we didn't get into town until after 9pm. The place was just as shown in the pictures, and was close to everything exciting around town. "

The only concern I would say is the noise from upstairs that’s been mentioned. If you are a light sleeper, or will be sleeping during day you might be challenged. The curtain separating the space from upstairs actually just hides the stairs. There is locked door going upstairs. You have complete privacy. It was cozy, clean, stylish and easy. I would recommend."
183354,24038986,539081786,2019-09-30,4726652,Wendy,"Perfect for our girls weekend in Denver! Very clean! Bigger than expected. Excellent location for us as we had a car and there was always a place to park, but you can Uber to anything in 10-15 minutes. Perfect hub for visiting several areas like Cherry Creek, downtown, and our day trips to Boulder and Red Rocks. Would stay here again. There was a little noise from the neighbor but not the whole time and as to be expected in a city apt. Slept great, kitchen was well appointed, decor was funky and fun, plenty of space. Price was great! Definitely recommend!"

One note is this is technically a duplex so you do share the house with neighbors but they tend to leave you alone with no issues.

We will definitely be staying here again when we come to denver. "
195457,25661155,321067977,2018-09-09,16150845,Claire,"Chelsea and Michael were spectacular hosts! The townhouse was just as advertised, and very comfortable for our party of 4 for a weekend wedding. The place is just two blocks away from a great coffee shop, which for us, made our stay all the better. The beds, which I've found to be hit or miss in some AirBnbs, were so comfortable and we all commented on how we slept so well during our stay. The kitchen had all the necessities you'd need to make a meal for a group, and everything was spotless. I also wanted to note, the third bedroom in the basement level, I was skeptical of at first, but it turned out to be fairly private (since it's separated from the other rooms by the main floor) and the fact that it has an ensuite bathroom really made the stay there comfortable. The hosts also made a binder with alot of insightful recommendations, which was so helpful, and Michael even took the time to respond over the weekend to my text msg request for a recommendation for a fun walking/shopping area. Overall, I'd highly recommend their place for your next stay in Denver."

The condo was very conveniently located to everything downtown and made it easy to travel for day trips to other locations. The house was incredibly clean and comfortable. The sauna was also an awesome added feature!

The home was literally 15 to 20 minutes away from every possible thing we could think to do on our stay. The home is in a beautiful location with plenty of amenities and Chuck is extremely responsive and was very helpful in providing us information about the local area. He was easily reachable by phone and text as well as replenished items we needed during our stay.  Interactions with our host was very positive and the home itself was a place I did not want to leave. I highly recommend this home to anybody in the area or within a driving distance of it, and I will definitely be coming back to stay here in the future. Thank you Chuck, Jordan and Scout!

Jennifer´s Sunny Retreat is in my eyes the best location for a trip to Denver. 
Ein wunderschönes Haus in einer ruhigen Gegend mit einem tollen Garten und das Beste an allem ist Jennifer selbst. Sie ist eine wundervolle Gastgeberin, offen tolerant und mit humor und viel sympathie für die reisenden die sie besuchen. Ich habe eine schöne Zeit bei Ihr gehabt, alles war perfekt und ich bedanke mich nochmals auf diesem Wege herzlich bei Ihr. Mögen alle Deine weiteren Gäste Dir wohlgesonnen sein um diese kleine Reiseoase in Denver so zu erhalten. Alles Gute und hoffentlich bis bald mal wieder!

I never met her in person, but she went out of her way to help me.  She also is extremely responsive and her friends nearby came over immediately when we had a very short internet issue (blame Comcast!) so that it was fixed right away.  The house itself is a wonder, and I'm jealous that she gets to live there full time (which also made me protective -- it's her home so please treat it respectfully!).  It is full of character, thoughtful design, comfortable furniture, the softest sheets, and with lots of outdoor space - three levels to boot!  Not to mention eco-friendly and solar powered.  I stayed here on a work trip with two colleagues, but would love to come back with some friends.    Thanks again to Paige for letting us stay there on our trip to Denver!"

The location, privacy, convenience, decor and comfort of our stay was exactly what we needed to make our trip perfect! It’s cozy, clean with a fun and stylish vibe. Being able to lay in bed and enjoy the city views was a lovely bonus."

We arrived late so it was dark and initially hard to see but once we opened the gate, the pathway was lit with automatic lights. Check in was easy! We found street parking easily each day at all hours. The space was comfortable and had all the needs for even a longer stay. Close to downtown Denver activities and day trips. Great weekend stay!"

Steve was quick to respond when we needed him and the touches in the apartment were lovely.  Great beds, and a beautiful shower. We didn't have any children with us, but the thoughtfulness of a portable crib and a pack diapers were even available in the space.  Definitely one of the BEST Air BnBs we have stayed in, and would definitely stay here again in a heart beat."

The home itself is older and thus has quirks like a lack of overhead lighting, bedroom doors that don't close fully, etc. Overall a nice place, but the location and the backyard were the best parts of it."

Jamie provided a laundry list of places to go. The apartment is a great size for two people looking to getaway and is centrally located in an unassuming part of town.

25298,4052272,101239290,2016-09-12,1695622,April,"Nikki's place was clean, comfortable, convenient, and full of personality.  What really made our week-long stay was Nikki and Ozone though! While we prefer the privacy of a separate unit (the basement unit we stayed in is private and accessible through the ""reading room"" which is pictured in the listing), we also enjoy being able to communicate with our host, which Nikki was a star at.  Very laid back and knowledgeable, and happy to share recommendations--we wish we could have tried every one!  The unit is decorated with a mix of artwork, some of it hers. Be sure to ask about it!  As someone who is sometimes wary of dogs, but still likes them, I appreciated the fact that Nikki let us know some commands and how to interact with Ozone, who has free access to the fenced and gated back yard and will greet you with vigor upon arrival!  He is an adorable pup who just wants to nap and play fetch.  

Street parking was always plentiful no matter the time or day.  The washer, dryer, and full kitchen were a big plus!  The location is a short drive or walk from City Park which is a local gem... we went back a few times during our stay, day and night.  The furthest of local tourist points are merely a 30 min drive or less with little traffic.  At the end of our stay, Nikki made a point to ask if we had any suggestions for the unit which spoke volumes about her as a host.

All in all, it was a very comfortable stay and we look forward to seeing Nikki and Ozone again in the future.  I would recommend the place to anyone!  Thanks Nikki!  And to Ozone: woof!"

I had an issue getting into the house when I first arrived and they answered my phone call immediately and got it all straightened out! They even have great suggestions for places to eat, drink, and go see near the house. I would definitely recommend staying at their place and I would stay again! :)"
110471,15957321,164321570,2017-06-27,2230351,Andrew,"Good location but you will need a car/Uber to get most places. Nice backyard, good kitchen, decent beds, easy check in. Beware that if sleeping downstairs, you won't be able to sleep if anyone is awake and walking around upstairs. Floors are really squeaky. So best downstairs for heavy sleepers or kids who can sleep through anything. I also stayed with people who were up extremely late so it might have seemed worse for me as I was the first one in bed. "

23526,3810191,91432652,2016-08-05,8140990,Ruddy,Cathy was amazing! She quickly responded to any questions we had. Suggestions were great and leaves a guidebook that made checking out the area so much easier!
135732,19116038,290046016,2018-07-13,24267387,Ola,The place comes as advertised. A room to yourself with all the amenities you could need. The entire house was in very clean condition. I enjoyed my stay.

The space was very neat and clean with plenty of amenities provided for our stay. Lindsey and Derek were very quick in responding, as well as helpful in giving us tips about what to do in the area. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
142872,19944363,459060069,2019-05-26,53614442,William,"We had a great stay at Susan’s place. Check-in was a breeze. We got in pretty late, and the pack’n play crib was already set up for our 7 month-old. Susan was extremely responsive to any questions that we had. The house itself was very clean and had a nice decor. It was also in a good location for accessing both other areas of the city and the mountains."
108875,15807599,254063068,2018-04-15,2771929,Nick,The house was perfect! It fit our group of 8 with ease. The three showers made getting everyone moving much faster than expected. The location was ideal and allowed for us to rest between activities. We all didn’t want to leave and will definitely stay at Cole & Julie’s place again.
33449,5334219,50306278,2015-10-11,42802311,Liz,"The place was awesome! Just like the photos, and super clean. There are a bunch of restaurants and things very close by to walk to, and it's super easy to get downtown.  There was no hassle getting in, and Susan was very responsive and accommodating."

68055,10392285,70912117,2016-04-22,18749824,Alison,"Ben was a fantastic host, and the place was spotless. This condo was located in a great location, and was perfect for our first night in Colorado, after flying into Denver. It's right next to a bus stop and there are plenty of ubers and lyfts around, making transportation a breeze. There are also some parking garages close by, which made things even easier for our rental car. Thanks for having us, Ben! "
30348,4718459,212005045,2017-11-15,57948070,Scott,"Upstairs apartment in a cute old house. Had everything I needed while working in downtown Denver. The location was perfect -- a short walk to Broadway restaurants and night life; easy access to bus, bike routes, Washington and Cheesman Park, Enterprise Rent-a-Car. Christina was responsive to every request."
214149,29155248,481998616,2019-07-05,52361994,Melissa,"Adrienne’s space was wonderful. Tasteful decorated and amazingly comfortable bed. The laundry room with mini fridge was perfect, as there were so many places for food to try in Denver we didn’t need a kitchen. The pictures with checkin helped to make the process a breeze! 
We especially loved how comfortable the bed was and the shower was perfect after a long day of hiking. We will definitely be back!"
102122,15116690,219457039,2017-12-17,137418011,Clay,We loved that the house was cute and colorful. We loved that we were given privacy when needed and were welcomed into a social atmosphere when desired as well. Highly recommend. The chillest of vibes.
134206,18933562,318513201,2018-09-03,54549001,Glen,"George’s condo was a perfect fit for our trip to Denver. His place was very clean, AC worked very strong, location was very easy for us to get around. The grocery store at the first floor has some sketchy people hanging out (homeless?) but they do mind their own business."
229114,32470069,434289666,2019-04-07,142076371,Luis,Highly recommend the solo room with the King bed. Has its own bathroom and fridge. Fun style. Everything was well kept and tidy. Great place. Thanks Musa!

12432,1733052,54705943,2015-11-23,43824178,Candace,"I had an excellent experience with Jason and Viveca. Their basement is spacious, and pretty much anything you could want for a short stay in Denver. They were excellent hosts, and very accommodating to my conference schedule, while I was there. I would definitely stay with them again if I make it back out to Denver. "
44235,7199544,547270155,2019-10-14,8620317,Scott,Rae’s space is reminiscent of a lodge. It exudes a great feeling of a getaway. Highly recommended!

181039,23746299,353126610,2018-11-26,36159579,Nick,Had an amazing stay! Highly recommended. The only thing that was missing was a TV. I was unaware that there wouldn’t be one in the home when booking the place. But other than that! 10/10 place!! Definitely would stay again.
186527,24344869,492761979,2019-07-21,242173542,Katelyn,Great place to stay if you just need  a bed to rest before or after a flight. Walking distance to places to eat.
39228,6348993,244509748,2018-03-18,115566473,Jesse,"Matt & Vicki's place was a great experience all around. They are very close with local businesses so they had great recommendations for coffee and food nearby. They even took care of the first coffee at the local coffee shop! My wife and I stayed in their basement and they had a fridge that was full of water for those who aren't used to the altitude. In addition to that, they had a TV in our bedroom with Netflix. Matt & Vicki have the hospitality thing down!!!"
59885,9169151,283379917,2018-06-29,17455120,Katie,"I didn't realize this space didn't have A.C. until we got there (didn't read thoroughly). I was a little concerned since it got up  to over 100 degrees whie we were there, but this space stayed comfortably cool the whole time! GREAT location, cute space, easy parking and friendly hosts! This is perfect for a Denver get away!"
82477,13059132,105964012,2016-10-03,14693740,Mahsa,great location 10 min drive from Union Station and Lodo and also close to interstate to venture out in the mountains. about 30 min drive from airport. we had a little trouble finding the entrance as its from the back of the house so it's a different street but Jessica was very helpful and gave clear directions on the phone (she had also emailed but sometimes verbal communication is easier). The space is cute and cosy and great for 2 people. bathroom and especially shower is a bit tiny but manageable for a 3 day stay. the neighborhood itself is awesome with tons of restaurants and cafes within walking distance. I have many food allergies/restrictions and it was great to have accessible allergen friendly food spots. the entrance is in a back alley so area can get a but sketchy at night but nothing extreme.
38877,6333040,220504702,2017-12-22,41190338,Ashley,"This place is perfect!! I love the decor and style of the carriage house, the history behind it is so cool! Prime location, close to downtown. Super clean too! Will definitely be booking again."
18528,2915068,35510710,2015-06-19,5291489,Clay,"A colleague and I stayed here for a business trip to Denver.  The house worked perfectly for us.  Great location near Washington Park (perfect for early morning runs).  Clean, comfortable, and functional.  Winton was also a great host.  Would stay here again!"
80064,12915068,195295665,2017-09-18,70522059,Rebeccah,"I don't know where to start! Staying at Leanne's home was where we started our trip in Colorado and our stay there played a big role in why we fell in the love with the place! They have a beautiful home - in a great location / neighborhood. The space was cozy, clean and provided privacy during our stay. I can go on and on - but if you're looking for somewhere clean and comfortable, within a great location to downtown as well as FRIENDLY welcoming hosts - I genuinely don't think you'll find any better. We couldn't be happier with our experience staying here - hopefully we'll be back soon!  Thanks again, Leanne."
192803,25262577,463606515,2019-06-03,114240955,Olivia,"Great location, central to everything we needed to do. Great neighborhood, felt very safe. The backyard was a major plus and it offered plenty of privacy."
66100,10040421,111537813,2016-10-31,97101798,Paolo,"The house was as described and Lori was a very welcoming host. She gave us plenty information and left us with a very organised kitchen; the rooms were very roomy and the toilet clean.
The location is waking distance from shops and nightlife. Would definitely stay there again!"
21466,3479122,319540735,2018-09-06,111994859,Colette,"This loft is great for single travelers or couples. The unique 3-floor layout is fun. The space was very clean and had everything you might need. The location is close to breweries, restaurants and Coors Field.

I would stay here again. It was an easy area for Lyft and Uber drivers to find, but still had plenty in walking distance. I’d recommend Snooze for breakfast/brunch.

Sam was an excellent host! He was helpful and responsive. Overall, a great Airbnb experience.

The only negative is being near a local shelter. There are a lot of homeless people, but most were very nice and kept to themselves. Just something to keep in mind if you’re not used to seeing that or it makes you uncomfortable."
28282,4288813,274249079,2018-06-08,152614175,Lindsey,"Wonderful, homey space in the heart of a historical neighborhood. This house is close to Five Points and the heart of RiNo and is an easy walk in both directions to both neighborhoods as well as downtown. Plenty of restaurants and coffee shops nearby which made for very few Uber rides during our stay. We loved it here!"
189676,24766200,338499615,2018-10-19,41838240,Steph,"This place is absolutely amazing!! We stayed for 2 nights and it was one of our highlights during our travels. 
The location is just perfect to explore Denver! It is just a quick drive to the City. 

The neighborhood has even more to offer: great restaurants, small shops and a great atmosphere! 

We felt home from the second we walked into the apartment! All these tiny details made this place even more beautiful than the pictures have already shown. I just want to mention this amazing bathroom with a luxurious shower!

We totally recommend this place! Ruth was so welcoming and easy to communicate. The next time we are in Denver, we will definitely stay at this place again! Thank you Ruth for the great Denver experience!!"
102550,15174189,291430304,2018-07-15,160292154,Andrea,"This was my first AirBNB experience, and it was better than I expected. Pam's place is a cute home, the room has it's own bathroom and its own private balcony, and there were appreciated touches such as the mini fridge with bottled water in it, the hot water maker for morning beverages, the candy dish, and the granola bars for snacking. Pam herself was very friendly and offered plenty of local tips.  Her dogs were very personable and willing to play fetch when I needed 20  minutes of decompression! I would willingly stay with Pam again!"
90977,13789731,162158299,2017-06-19,37996330,Leah,"This was a very charming and large apartment. We loved the private balcony and the big sunny rooms. Very comfortable and clean, and would be a good place to stay for a large family.  "
9266,937952,3767817,2013-03-12,5257167,Larissa,"Amanda's place was great!!  Felt like a real home.  She left a great guidebook that gave us instructions on EVERYTHING we needed to know and some great local spots to check out.  Her place was clean, comfortable, warm and smelled good.  She was fantastic at keeping in touch.  We also took away some great design ideas. :)"
143480,20033468,234690228,2018-02-13,167368693,Cole,"This was a lovely place to stay for our long weekend! It is super close to lots of restaurants, a tasty froyo place and the mountains are only a short drive (25ish minutes to Red Rocks and Lookout Mountain). The place was very clean, bed was comfy and the skylight in the bedroom was a fun surprise! Seltzer water in the fridge was a plus too. No porch light so at night it is super dark out front, but that was really the only real complaint besides maybe the kitchen. Kitchen wasn't really made for cooking a full meal as there was no pepper, cooking oil or cutting board but was great for breakfast and lunch! The patio out front was lovely and I would imagine nice in the summer time. Overall, we had an awesome time and would definitely stay again :)"
58964,9108143,100082659,2016-09-07,48722641,Andy,"We had such a wonderful stay at this beautiful little carriage house that my 3 year old daughter kept asking if we could go back to the ""brick house"" instead of going home! The house is gorgeous and only a short walk (or drive if you are lazy like me) from some amazing coffee shops, restaurants, breweries and even an urban winery.
Ashlee was responsive and very helpful and we loved our time there, we will definitely be back again!"
195043,25586560,343745121,2018-11-01,205041339,Jordan,"Cozy, centrally located apartment.
Due to its specific location and orientation, my wife and I actually enjoyed a bit more privacy than we’d expected, despite our proximity to the myriad attractions and apartments nearby.
Quaint little pub just at the corner!"
42395,6891514,242659605,2018-03-12,155953721,Abigail,"DO NOT GO HERE!!!! STAY AWAY! READ REVEIW. AWFUL!! This is not your own apartment kind of deal even though it does say in the listing it is. As well as there is no private bathroom. She’s using people for money to pay rent because she doesn’t work. You share everything except your room. Elizabeth has two dogs, one of which is pretty big size. This dog would sit on the couch waiting for you to walk into the house (that’s suppose to be private so I shouldn’t have to be scared to walk to my fucking room) that barks and growls at you till you’ve safely ran into a closed door room. This happened every night for 5 nights. It had gotten worse the longer we were there and i couldn’t go downstairs alone because I was so terrified of the dog. Also, my sister works late at night and we were not given a key to get in at our connivence so Elizabeth’s dog would bark for 15 minutes until someone let my sister in. (This was not our fault. Wasn’t given a key, was suppose to be alone and have no dog around) mind you Elizabeth doesn’t work or sleep either and would stay up really late like us and sleep in. So I’m sharing this house with this lady and she leaves the last night and tells me she won’t be home till early the next day, and of course her demon dog is out and about in the house without his master to console him. Tried to lock the dog away but he got out. I was screaming running from the dog that night. We stayed up late that night and I took a bath at 2 am that was completely forbidden and this woman got home early and busted through the locked bathroom door to where I was naked in the bath and started to yell. After I got out, she proceeded to bang pots and pans all around her kitchen from 3 am till 10 am when we left. We got no sleep that night. My sister and I were the only two people staying. Elizabeth gives off the vibes of an aggressive drug user who act irrationally. I felt uncomfortable and scared the whole stay."
37521,5990927,424018626,2019-03-15,55268938,Michael,This is a great space especially for 420 friendliness. They took care of every need and fulfilled every request!

13936,1959836,14736016,2014-06-25,6396897,Qwejue,Anne was an amazing host! I got into town a little late in the night and she was extremely accommodating. Even took me out to dinner. Her house was extremely quite and comforting. Great art work to look at all throughout her house. Would definitely stay there again!

193391,25342433,327430918,2018-09-23,118499605,Nick,If you are trying to do downtown Denver and the Mountains this is the place to stay. Very cozy and perfectly located. This made my trip to Denver that much better.
34477,5433111,115701410,2016-11-26,46547247,Ben,"We loved the place, and we absolutely love how clean the house was. The neighborhood has a lot of good places for breakfast. We were able to park our car inside, which made us feel safe, and definitely a consideration for those who planned to visit Denver using a car. We tried to connect to the WiFi, but sadly we had connecting to the Internet. Overall, it was a great stay and we would consider coming back."
221653,30742596,550942546,2019-10-19,124605725,Michael,"Great space, comfortable and spacious.  Only downside was their wifi signal was not very strong downstairs, we ended up using our own mobile hotspot for wireless connection.  Otherwise, highly recommend!"
115089,16392236,527804604,2019-09-11,184854210,Jeff,Taylor and Nicole were great. Great communication before and during stay. House is nice and the location is perfect.

She was a gracious, considerate, very warm host. There's a reason her reviews are so high - a very welcoming woman."
1926,81540,1188676,2012-04-27,2047580,Lisa,"Great, central location. Perfect accomodations for 2 people. Be prepared for a tiny bathroom, but otherwise great. We're looking forward to moving to Denver and recommending a stay with Jess for any guests we can't fit!"

66563,10190798,83965520,2016-07-04,6778344,Rhonda,"Not the best Airbnb experience but certainly not the worst. Beds were comfortable but sheets felt dirty and sharp then found a few toenails on them...surfaces were all dusty upon entrance, wifi didn't work, shampoo was empty in shower, and host didn't send check in information until we requested it 3 hours before our visit began. I would stay here if you solely needed a place to crash in the Highlands with a group, but don't care for a flawless or extremely hospitable experience."
88238,13560410,510806724,2019-08-16,276724705,Casian,"The best place to stay in Denver. Matt has earned the rightful title as super host! You will have a great time staying here. The location is great, uber rides to the best dispensary in the area are $7 , and a ride to downtown will cost no more than $16. The jacuzzi at night will make you want to stay forever. The water pressure in the bathroom is heaven! Matt and Robin have themselves a slice of heaven! Enjoy the place and respect their property!"

In the description, Shelby and Jon mentioned that some noises might be heard from them and their animals- this is true. Not unbearable, but be aware that you will easily hear whats going on upstairs.

1832,74125,36602455,2015-06-29,1582986,Jaebi,"Reading the other reviews accurately depicted what I found upon walking into Joe's spread and here's my piece: If I lived in Denver, I'd totally buy a place like this!

Plenty of space but not a lot of wind. Felt stuffy at times but I was out a lot and it didn't get to hot. There's one bedroom and an open space to crash. I made that space my room because there is art in ever corner or the tools to make some and that's totally how I like to live. There was a keyboard, a drum set, a few reams of books, I felt pretty inspired.

The bathroom was pretty unconventional for me, with it's four-legged tub, not affixed to any wall, a round flight of stairs leading down in the middle of it, a sink that pretty much stands alone on the rail of said staircase and then the toilet somewhere off in the corner. Nothing wrong here, actually pretty cool, esp. if you share the bathroom with a lover(s), each of you can have a little pocket of space to yourself. But again, I'm a New Yorker. Cramped is normal.

I heard the neighbors but didn't see any. They weren't loud, just the normal sounds you'd expect to hear in an apt. building. The best part was Joe, who I never met, but had great communication and set us up to arrive smooth and easy. Hmm, what else.

Yes! The post it mural, which wasn't exactly what I expected but I'm not sure how much I can say about it. Definitely artistic, which again, I loved.

Would definitely stay again!"

It was a terrific location and centrally located which made it easy to get around all the main sights of Denver.  Street parking was also very convenient right in front of the house.

The pictures show a nice house, but the house is above and beyond the pictures.  It is very well appointed down to high end linens, the hardwoods and even brilliant light fixtures.  The house is very clean and super comfortable.  The house has 2 bedrooms, 1 bath, a nice open floor plan, very very comfortable furniture, high end linens and appliances.  The beds are super comfy.  You have everything you need to cook, hang and relax after a great day in exploring Denver.  The internet is fast and reliable and the living area has a large TV with cable, netflix, and so on. 

The house is on a very quiet street and convenient to many things. The house is about a 13 minute walk to my favorite spots in Highlands, 5 minute drive to Sprouts, Tennyson, close to 70 and 25, and popular spots like Sunnyside, Lohi, Berkley. 

I will definitely come back here and highly recommend this place to anyone.   Thank you Mallory for opening up your beautiful home and creating a Denver Oasis. "

9605,1035821,477617995,2019-06-28,95053684,Linda,"Good location for walking over to Coors field, with a super cute coffee shop and pub/restaurant in the neighborhood. Was a little disappointed that the front patio was overgrown with weeds and there was nowhere to congregate outside on such a nice evening. Water pressure wasn’t great and some of the amenities a little short, but overall we were satisfied for our one-night stay."

They were extremely responsive to all of my communications, they were able to accommodate an early check-in, the place was super clean/spacious (plenty of space for 4 people) and the bed was SO comfortable. 

The location is great—not in the heart of downtown, but close enough to walk (35ish minutes) if you are able/only a $6 Uber ride. Also, a number of restaurants and bars in the immediate area. 

Such a great value, I highly recommend staying here!"
241457,37211561,537439038,2019-09-28,189627469,Jenna,We stayed at this location for our last minute honeymoon to Denver. We loved our stay at this Airbnb! The home was clean and comfortable. Location was awesome. Many locations are just a short walk away.

113935,16304484,308606881,2018-08-16,4120288,Paul,"Ryan's place is just as it is shown on his airbnb page.  So future guest know, there are two sets of stairs up to the space and it is in a very nice residential area, so restaurants are a bit of a walk away, about two blocks to Dazbog coffee on East 9th Ave and  5 blocks to East Coalfax Ave with voodoo donuts and  The Irish Snug, an excellent  Irish Pub.  As for the apartment its is just as shown on Ryan's page.   We used the portable AC. Lastly the bed is very comfortable .   Thanks Ryan "

The house in a great location, is very comfortable, and an overall great space to stay while you're in Denver.  During our stay Kodie was available for questions & chit-chat, and even provided an air mattress for my fiancé.   It was a treat to enjoy some fresh eggs for breakfast and feed the chickens our leftover fruit, too.   We had a great time staying in the carriage house and would try to stay here again if in Denver.

This place is so close to so much cool stuff that’s an easy walk, scooter, bike, bus ride, or lyft to. Perfect little central hub! The restaurants next to the home aren’t great but good for munchies lol! We had a fabulous time in Denver, would definitely return."

6563,760023,78366921,2016-06-06,67068898,Savannah,"Jill's house was beautiful, and she and her husband were welcoming and accommodating. I was in and out quite a bit, as I was in Denver for a writing workshop and had good friends who had just moved to the area, and I felt very comfortable coming and going (and sitting in the lovely garden). Jill was very helpful when it came to recommending restaurants and the like in the area, and the neighborhood was beautiful, a five-minute walk away from City Park. I would definitely recommend staying with Jill, especially for people visiting Denver for the first time (such as myself)."

192357,25219351,275792200,2018-06-11,12326254,Melanie,"We stayed three nights at Marcs place. Contact with him was very easy, fast and precise. When we arrived everything was prepared we even got shampoo, washing gel, body lotion and body scrub. The room is nicely decorated and good ventilated (ventilator and air conditioning). The bed is very big and so comfortable we slept like babies :) :)
The location is good. We always took an Uber to the city center. It takes around 5-10 minutes and costs around 6 Dollars. 
Breakfast was in the room price included. We asked for granola and almond milk and got very high quality and delicious meals. It was very appreciated!
Thanks again for the very nice hosting! 
We really enjoyed our time there and would definitely recommend to stay with Marc."

184607,24134572,512926162,2019-08-18,107367637,Sean,"Zachary was fantastic! I asked a few silly questions that if I were patient and looked through the check-in process on the App I would have seen. That said, Zachary did not mind answering my silly questions and his communication was friendly and super quick!

The condo was beyond comfortable and quite spacious. The back patio was an awesome place to hangout and enjoy the privacy of our own space. I would definitely stay here again if every in the area. 

Thanks so much, Zachary!"
223906,31262420,542697269,2019-10-06,263650660,Mark,"Bethany and Nick were wonderful hosts. From the start they communicated quickly with us and went out of their way to help us with an early arrival. Their place had all the amenities we needed for our 10 day stay, and they checked-in with us mid-stay to see if we needed anything in addition to what they already provided. The unit is a furnished basement apartment, so there's normal footstep traffic to be heard at times, but it was nothing that interfered with our schedules and it wasn't at night. Their house is within a quick walk or Lyft/Uber from most anything you could want to do in Denver. We enjoyed every moment of the stay and plan to stay with them again on any future trips to the area."
148535,20697678,192931335,2017-09-11,143324880,Javier,"Many thanks to Ryan and Sean for being such awesome hosts. The neighborhood is quiet, just steps from Cheesman Park and Colfax Ave. You can easily walk to the Colfax bars, or if you're feeling particularly adventurous, all the way downtown. Ryan was more than accommodating and very welcoming. If you're looking for an awesome stay in Denver, this is the place."

Loved not having to search for a place to plug in my cell phone charger, and it was great to be able to sign in to our apps on the tv to watch shows. Add in the cleanliness and other thoughtful touches, and it was fantastic. We will be back!"
134111,18909046,174375909,2017-07-25,33788038,Angela,"My boyfriend and I were looking for affordable accommodations in Denver and found Christina's apartment. It was exactly as advertised--clean, had the basic necessities, and was a convenient uber ride or drive into the heart of the city. You can tell Christina and her husband took a lot of care in providing a nice experience for their guests, and had a helpful guide book filled with recommendations and useful info. The apartment was garden level, but with the fans provided it stayed nice and cool throughout the day and night. The only real issue we found was that because it was a basement apartment, it sometimes felt a bit damp and stuffy. I think a de-humidifer would do wonders! Other than that we had a great stay here. Nice quiet chill neighborhood with plenty of on-street parking and a cute backyard space. This is the perfect rental for a couple looking for an inexpensive but clean and comfortable space to rest their head at night!"
15639,2175370,551988674,2019-10-20,132387585,Nancy,"Barbara's standing as a Superhost is well earned.  Her house is warm and welcoming.  She has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable.  Little treats in each room, warm throws in the living room, coffee in your room or using the Keurig in the kitchen, and many other little touches.  It felt like home.  Thank you Barbara!"

We were asked to smoke in a small room really cramping the vacation, under impression that smoking in Denver in a legal residence wouldn't be a problem..  But as far as convenience it is no more than 10 mins away from everything. And it was very clean and up to date!"

112025,16089404,331458686,2018-10-02,131912474,Mike,"Great logistical option for larger groups, as this place is about as close as you can get to the heart of the city while still being in a house. About a 25 minute walk to the heart of Larimer, or a 5 minute Uber, but other services are closer. There was a market about 2 blocks away, and coffee and restaurants only about a 10 minute walk away. The house itself was clean and spacious, with all the amenities we needed."
119331,16914193,321099906,2018-09-09,145864654,Jorge,"Gary's home was similar to finding hidden treasure within Airbnb! His home had so many novelties and antiques that made it feel like an adventure in itself. A part from the rich history inside the home,  the home was also fully furnished ...and had everything we wanted and more! Many cooking supplies,  coffee with sugar and cream,  high speed wifi, cable TV, a nearby park which was great for the run wer took early in the morning,  and conveniently located near the expressway and a whole foods! Gary also kept very good communication throughout our stay and helped us with every question we had. Would definitely reccomend his place to anyone looking in the Denver area!"

The neighborhood was great and I easily arrived by taking the light rail from the airport to the house. I enjoyed running around Sloan’s Lake each morning. The burger at Burger Tap&Social is not to be missed!"

It was super to be able to be close to each other (walkable) and still have privacy. Chris and Jen rolled with us changing the timing, were super easy to work with, and made our stay logistically straight forward. Place was great and had what we needed. I would stay here again."

It was very convenient to several appointments we had in Denver.  The neighborhood was very quiet and felt very safe.  He was very responsive when we asked for his assistance.  It made our stay in Denver great and we will try to stay with Jeffery again in the future.

To top it all of he offers it all at a superb rate. I'd give him 6 stars if I could. (Dog is friendly, just gotta feed him a snack or two.)"
20244,3412478,87555560,2016-07-20,31878705,Jake,Cozy and unique spot in a quiet area of town. Brandy was very sweet and made sure I was accommodated perfectly. Her 3 cats made me feel at home and were very sweet :). Would definitely recommend this place to friends!

The apartment is just as described - clean and with the added touches of the dishes, coffee, and soap/shampoo it felt like we didn’t have to worry about anything while we were there.

Jenna went above and beyond to communicate with us and fix things efficiently when the hot water went during our stay.   She had suggestions for parking and what to see/do/eat in the area.  

She was a great host and i would recommend staying here to anyone."

We found the location to be quiet (despite being July 4th weekend!) and just a little ways out of the city proper. We would have liked to have been a little closer to downtown, as we relied on Uber and Lyft to get around, but there are other public transit options close by. We chose not to use them. 

Communication was seamless and directions very easy for check-in."

66073,10040421,91248382,2016-08-04,8095905,Elizabeth,The location within Denver is good.  Right by City Park with museums and weekend activities.  I reserved the place for my parents who were in town and just needed to stay somewhere for one night.  The space was fine for their stay.

The room was comfortable and clean and the owner offered quality toiletries (shampoo, soap, etc) in the bathroom. I spent quite a bit of time hanging in the backyard garden with the chickens. What an unexpected delight! Steps away from the botanical gardens. Highly recommend. Thank you for your hospitality, Pamela!"

A large open living room and bar area in immaculate shape welcomes you as soon as you walk in. The bathroom was spotless, with a luxury shower and Jacuzzi bathtub. The bedroom was also very comfortable. Jason was a great communicator and offered coffee and snacks in the morning. I would definitely stay again! 5 Stars!"

The location is great in a fun neighborhood with easy access to downtown. The place was clean and cozy. The only recommendation I would have is to consider your height before you book, if you are over 6 foot the ceilings may be a tad low for you. Overall an amazing spot we were sad to leave!"

Located in the historic district just outside of downtown Denver. My boyfriend and I enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and seeing the beautiful brick houses. The bedroom was also very romantic with the exposed brick and vintage-looking windows above the bed. The kitchen was excellent with a gas-range stove. The bathroom was very stylish. The backyard courtyard was a great added perk. To sum, everything about this place is great. "

Having a pet and taking a short walk to the Berkley Park Dog Park was wonderful for our 4-legged companion. A short distance to I-70 or trips down Federal, Wadsworth or Sheridan Blvds made getting around easy. The house is truly a charmer making the best of a small cozy place. It was great. Thanks Eli."

I stayed at Ayla's place for ten weeks during my physical therapy clinical rotation, and I could not have asked for a more clean, comfortable place. The renovated basement was private, big, had my own bathroom, and the bed was extremely comfortable. Her animals were really friendly, and Mulder (the cat) was always keeping me company. Ayla herself was always available if I had any questions, and we became friends fast! Downtown Denver was about a 12-15 minute Uber/Lyft ride away, and was inexpensive to get there. I would highly recommend this Airbnb, and if I come back to Denver to visit, I'll be sure to stay here again."

The place is right on a busy road, but easy to get in and out, and not as loud as you'd expect. There is a perfect shared yard between tenants, and it is blocked off for privacy! Very clean place, comfortable couch, and a TV with netflix. Neighbors were more than quiet, and polite. Shower is awesome with great pressure. I would say to get a pizza cutter, scissors, and maybe a larger spoon piece. Other than that, I can't wait to rent this place again next time I'm able to get in town. Super affordable, extremely nice inside. Perfect."

Little details such as cooking spices, a well stoked bathroom, and access to Netflix made the stay all the better. Noise from the street was a little loud due to the building insulation itself, but otherwise I would highly recommend this centrally located apartment!"

The master bath was one of the highlights for me, the tub was amazing! We also spent a lot of time on the balcony which had wonderful views of the city and the mountains. We hosted a get together with 15+ people and the space was perfect! I’m very pregnant so the stairs were a bit of a killer but I knew and expected that. No complaints, we had a fantastic stay. The property is gorgeous."

It is open, welcoming, lots of open spaces to relax in while inside, a great pooch as well, and in a great location. The room itself was excellent, very clean and all ameneties you would need for a great stay. The check-in was smooth, and we got to chat with DaNelle a bit, and she is one down to earth human being who I would not hesitate to stay at her place again, or hang out with at any time! If you have any doubts don't, its worth it! This place will be my #1 go to when in Denver! "

The bed was a little on the firmer side. We happened to meet Jack, and he was very kind and thoughtful. Overall, we had a great time here on our last night in Colorado!"

94281,14058998,351115117,2018-11-21,33365963,Justin,The perfect stay for anyone visiting Denver.  The host took the time to understand what you enjoy (and don't) in order to offer the best recommendations of things to do.  Jackie was so accommodating with anything you need and the place was immaculate with a ton of space.  Highly recommend any of her listings.
242275,37628327,560128429,2019-11-05,92800069,Tawnie,"The space here is so unique it is worth the stay just for that. That being said Erick and Alex were so hospitable and had nearly anything you could think of. The amount of time put into this place shows. The doors with keypads were easy to use, the heated floors were so nice and the hot tub was great for the night! The eggs, coffee, milk, bagels were really thoughtful and appreciated. Lola was so sweet and I loved seeing her as well. Definitely check out a room if you are in the area!"

This was the perfect place! The location is ideal and the home is charming. Christina was always very quick to respond if we had any questions or needed anything. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone, whether you need a place long-term or just for a weekend getaway."

Seamless self check-in, host responded in less than a minute when we couldn't get the code right.  Great home base for downtown Denver activities.  Perfect for mom, dad and teenage son.  Definitely on our repeat list for Denver.  "

Their guest rooms look like an HGTV remodel ... great taste in their design,  furniture, and kitchen & bath appointments. 

Our stay was very comfortable. For a city location overnight parking was just in front of the house. The jetted bathtub was very large. (Note: the tub walls are quite high. If you have mobility/climbing/stability difficulties and need to shower this space will not work for you).

We would stay there again.

It is a brand new build and has all the high end finishes. It was super clean and spacious. Beds were so comfortable and house has two large tvs. The community it is located in, is well thought out and has everything you could want. There are numerous pools and playgrounds and all the streets have side walks. Shopping, food, activities are all in close proximity. Jared picked us up from the airport and brought us to the house. He had beer in the fridge, fruits, and other items that you would need immediately. He checked in with us often to see if we needed anything and was only a phone call/ text away. He even gave my daughter toys to play with. Our experience was excellent and we will definitely stay here again in the future. I can't say enough wonderful things about the home and the host!!! I already miss it!"
17088,2361919,22903180,2014-11-17,22697410,Jessica,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I can't say enough about how amazing my trip was. The place looked exactly like the pictures, and was better in person. Annette gave me specific directions on the phone, and after talking with her the first time I felt like I knew her.  The place was quiet and we really felt like we had on own private studio apartment in Denver. Annette's dogs are gentle giants. The neighborhood had beautiful parks and great restaurants. We hope to return to Denver and stay at the same place!"

The guest suite stays cool at night and the various fans help as well. The bathroom is very clean and the bed comfortable. You can use the grill but we did not take advantage which was a shame on our part.

Close to Denver and especially the Denver Zoo. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice weekend!"

126709,18002228,350879423,2018-11-20,155987417,Dale,"If you want an early check in I would make sure she knows exactly what room you are renting! We arrived very early(8am) and got in prob around 2pm only because her husband came check on us and he said we could go in right then and there and said she though we were getting the other room that was not ready. So we were happy to get in a hour early but would have really been awesome if she would have known the room we were getting so that we could have got in soon after the others moved out around 10am. Her husband is absolutely the nicest person ever. Answered any questions we had and check in on us the perfect amount of times to feel cared about but also private.  The beds were absolutely amazing me and my Sgt felt it was an amazing sleep after a 17 hour drive! Home was stylish I like my person little balcony we had with some chairs to sit on! Right in the middle of it all! We had a car but there was plenty walking distance! She was very good on info with the surrounding area and places to see! Over all really good would stay again! One of the other apartment it look as though they were not to happy about us smoking on the balcony (her husband told us we had permission to do so, I made sure to ask him before we did it) but that was the only unkind experience we had and it wasn’t with her or her husband and was just a a few comments about us smoking on our balcony on there way out the house. Her husbands hospitality really mad up for the little uncomfortable moment we had! If it wouldn’t have been for that I would have rated this a 5 star. We will be coming back for a fact because it’s really a nice place in the heart of it all with two very nice ppl to talk to if you want! She texted back ASAP and he was very nice and answered any questions in person when we arrived!"

A point of consideration is that if you're very tall, this may be a bit confining for you. I'm not tall, so it was great."
199161,26281796,353815618,2018-11-29,25766928,Roxanne,Monica and John provided exactly what I needed - a cosy spot close to the airport for me to stay during a layover. Great communication before and during my stay - would recommend for sure!

Rebecca and Charlie were excellent hosts, they assisted us in all we needed and beyond. The kids are adorable and respectful. The cat is just as the family, very friendly. The listing was very accurate. The room is exactly as showed in the pictures, the bed is comfortable. The bathroom was near the room, the shower is beautiful. Inside the bathroom they have a washing machine and they let you use it. We were in the middle of our travel with no clean clothes and this was great. Kyle (he rents the other room) was also very nice in assisting us in how to use the washing machine. The kitchen is amazing, one of the most complete residential kitchen I've ever seen. They let us use it and they offered us all we needed to prepare our meals (oil, butter, crackers and delicious home made jam). The neighborhood is very nice and quiet. There are two different bus routes relatively near the house. We enjoyed our time there, we will definitely rent this listing if we go back to Denver. This experience of having a family while away from home is something that you will never experience in a hotel. I wish them success with their listing.   "

Wonderful location, walking distance from multiple dining options (Avanti and Prost brewery 30 seconds away, root down restaurant, little man ice cream -awesome! + downtown Denver,  Coors field and much more.) Todd’s place was sparking clean, well furnished and stocked with all amenities needed.  We also spent a day in the Rockies which was another delight. The rooftop balcony was a special treat. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly. We were a family of 4, wife and I, and 2 adult children. One item to point out is that one of the bedrooms is not fully enclosed and therefore not private - it is in the entranceway right when you enter the townhouse. Other than that, it was a perfect place for our family getaway. Thanks for hosting us Todd!"

His space is right in the heart of Denver and proves plenty of amenities for the seasoned traveler. I would 10/10 recommend
98977,14824298,298834723,2018-07-29,65946985,Allie,"Kristi's home was perfect for our group of seven. It is located in a cute neighborhood (walkable to some restaurants and a liquor store) and just a short drive from the LoHi and LoDo areas we spent most of our time in. 

The space is decorated nicely and has all of the kitchen and toiletry amenities you would want. The only issue we had upon arrival was immediately dealt with with zero issues.

I would highly recommend Kristi's house for up to 8 adults. We loved it!"

There was also a lot of awesome personal touches like a cute little note greeting my friends and I as we walked in. We were also greeted with muffins, water, coffee (Keurig), popcorn, and one amazing wall fireplace. They also had many labels throughout the place making everything easy to find. The couch beds were super comfy.  This place is also super close to the airport which was perfect for us, yet it is a drive to the heart of Denver. One thing that was a bother to us all was the constant thumping coming from upstairs. Since this place is essentially the basement of this home and the family does live there, during our stay we could hear the thumping of them moving around or running up and down the stairs. Even though it is somewhat expected in a two story home, it would have been nice not to hear a lot of movement especially since some of us are light sleepers. At the end of the day, we still enjoyed our stay there and would recommend to anyone."

On the small side but just fine for 2 people. The communication was excellent- if I needed anything, I got a quick response. There can be some noise since it's attached to a house but it's not much. Great location. close to downtown, fairly walkable, and 2 blocks from the light rail. If we came back to Denver, we'd definitely stay here again!"

The house is very cute, which made me a little skeptical being that I had a group of 5 people, but we all ended up fitting very comfortably! I would definitely recommend this home for anyone! "

First, the apartment is super clean, extremely functional and has all the comforts of home.  Secondly, the owners are very accommodating and gave us great tips and advice for our visit.  Third, the unit is located in a neat neighborhood within walking distance of most downtown attractions.  Also, there is a Whole Foods store 1.5 blocks away.  There is a television but no cable.  But you shouldn't be watching TV when so much of Denver is so close by!  We loved this place!"

It was a great central location, the dispensary down the street was very convenient, and Tami was very accommodating. I would not stay here if you like privacy or if you don't smoke. For everyone else, this place is really good for young people who just want to hangout and have a good time."

15720,2216969,93979246,2016-08-14,44128028,Amanda,"Jeffrey is an excellent and attentive host.  He saved our vacation after we ended up needing to find another place in Denver. The original Air B&B we booked was bad news for many reasons and we were not comfortable staying so we had to find another place on the fly.  I found Jeffrey's place, booked and checked in in less than an hour. He greeted my fiance and I out front,  gave us a quick tour and let us know to contact him if we needed anything.  This place should not be missed.  It was a welcome calm after all the craziness of being on the road. This place is exactly as it seems from the pictures.  Very peaceful and quiet area,  great if you are looking to stay in a great location that is tucked away. There is an outdoor area to enjoy some sunshine and a small kitchen also.  Bed was very comfortable and the linens and towels were fluffy clean and fresh. We will definitely book this place again when we return to Denver."
50325,7948813,97706180,2016-08-28,67081181,Erin,"The neighborhood was wonderful, very charming, fabulous park within blocks (Sloan lake). We walked to a bagel shop and slohi coffee shop every morning. The proximity to Denver attractions without being stuck staying in downtown was very convenient. The house was very clean, easy to check in, and the host was very quick to respond to questions leading up to our stay. We had no need to contact the host during our stay, as everything was explained in a welcome book when we arrived. I would definitely stay here again if I travel to Denver in the future. Much better than staying in a hotel!!!"
47703,7663335,83869770,2016-07-04,33594001,Kelley,"My boyfriend and I were visiting Denver for the first time over 4th of July weekend. John's apartment was a perfect fit for us. The apartment was modern and the pictures are very accurate. Can't attest to the kitchen use or tv, as we really just used the place to sleep and shower during our weekend of exploring the city! We also didn't fly out until the evening and John was kind enough to allow us to leave our bags at the apartment later than check-out time. During that time, John came to the apartment to clean for the next guest and found a dress I left in the closet and placed it on our luggage- greatly appreciated!! Highly recommend John's place- great location! Great experience! "

I actually used the large bathroom with a skylight upstairs to sleep my 2 year old in his pack n play and he slept great!!! Located right next to a Whole Foods and a delicious breakfast spot called the Duffeyroll. 15 minutes to everywhere for kids stuff. I'll be back!

This was our first experience with AirBnb, and it exceeded all of our expectations. This apartment was very spacious, our son had his own room, the kitchen was bigger than most apartments I've had, and the living space was large but also very cozy. We met Harold in passing during our trip and he was very friendly, asked how we were doing and responded to messages within minutes. He provides a manual when you check in where we found fabulous recommendations for local restaurants, coffee shops etc. You couldn't ask for a better location for a first trip to Denver!"

The space is very accommodating; there’s more than enough room, the house is filled with everything one could need on a long stay, and it is really private. Feels nice and homey. The location is great and the price is very reasonable. It was nice to have the parking space, but there is also a lot of easy additional street parking for visitors with more than one vehicle. Corey is friendly and a good host!"

She picked me up from the airport and took me back, and also gave me suggestions about what to check out while I was there. Her dogs, Pepper and Bella, are extremely friendly and will want you to play fetch with them! 

The room was very cozy and interaction with other guests was friendly. I'd highly recommend staying here!"

119652,16947747,517783971,2019-08-25,19169136,Tyler,"The treehouse was the icing on the cake having rented out the main house for my bachelor party. It was the perfect space for a couple friends who were able to make it last minute, with a huge comfortable bed and a surprisingly comfortable chaise. It's a great spot for a couple, with plenty of privacy from the main house, while still being very connected if you have a large group at the house. Diana and Vinny are wonderful hosts and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was great with quick, helpful communication. Couldn't recommend their place more!"
134674,18963379,247467927,2018-03-28,77700274,Tana,"It's a great place. Great hosts, good location, a short drive to almost everywhere you could want to go and a quick walk to 16th St Mall and Larimer Square. 
It is pretty family friendly and you definitely feel safe which is great considering your downtown.
Parking was super tight and the basement can feel a bit creepy, but the building had great security features. 
The unit itself felt spacious, but a heads up that there is no lock on the door to the patio/ledge (although it was a bit heavy for my toddler to move fast enough to not be caught). It's also worth noting the front door doesn't have a separate lock so children are able to unlock the deadbolt and open the door just by pulling on the door handle. The master bedroom doors are pocket doors without locks, but are audible when moved and we set up a work around at night in case of any kiddo adventures. 
Also, the dryer takes forever to get the small loads from the washer dry so be prepared to run it a couple times per load, but it's nice to have a W/D avail when traveling with children.  
Overall it's a bit on the higher end, but a decent value with included parking. It's super clean, safe, and a pretty nice location! Everything was professional, easy, and they were super friendly! 
We totally recommend staying at Dana and Patrick's."

The beds were very comfy, convenient parking, very private, super clean, nice t.v., wifi and the hosts were genuinely nice people. It was only 10 minutes from the airport and just a few minutes away from walmart, the supermarket, gas station and a variety of retail, fast food, Walgreens and Dunkin. It was half hour from Denver and from the Red Rocks Amphitheater. For sure this will be my go to apartment when I go back to Colorado. My son calls it his Colorado home lol!"

Check in was super easy with a keypad at the door. Wifi was lightning fast and the couch is so comfy for nighttime emailing in front of the TV. It was nice to not have the usual cold leather couch at an AirBnB and you could see they'd just freshly vacuumed the couch! Decor is lush and updated. Bed was great. Kitchenette is perfect - just like you'd see at a hotel with one - complete with coffee maker and even some snacks! The garden apartment is underneath the main house so you hear some sound upstairs, but nothing distracting. Highly recommend for any business traveler!"
26701,4227772,201689128,2017-10-08,4058197,Lori,"No problems! Fast communication, incredibly accommodating, and a very clean space - just as described!  Completely fenced in yard was a bonus as we needed to bring our dog at the last minute."

32959,5070640,167051440,2017-07-05,49604312,Lachlan,"Strongly recommended.   The carriage house is very comfortable, well-equipped and well-supplied and in a nice peaceful neighbourhood. I ran most days in the neighbouring streets and it is very pleasant. Off-street parking is a plus. Supermarkets (2 miles), restaurants and shops (walkable) are all close We spent a very happy week here: many thanks! "
157442,21297522,224633255,2018-01-03,36473738,Laura,"I absolutely loved staying at this home. The owners are kind and accommodating and their house is clean, well-furnished and full of amenities - my friends and I loved that we could make coffee in the morning, and when coffee was spilled on white pants, we also had full access to laundry! I would absolutely recommend this airbnb to anyone looking to spend some time in Denver."

1361,39405,121509212,2016-12-17,26733675,Melissa,"Jeny and Gio's place was absolutely incredible. It has everything you might want or need - coffee and coffeemaker and tea, instant oatmeal, pop and other beverages in the fridge, and ice in the freezer. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and has a TV with Netflix/Hulu/Amazon mounted right at the foot of the bed! The cottage itself was cozy and adorable, with just the right amount of space for two people. It got to 0 degrees outside but we were never cold between the heater and the fluffy blankets and pillows. The hot tub is super easy to use and so nice on a cold night, and street parking is convenient and easy to find. It's super easy to Uber to points of interest in the city - we loved the art museum. We had an amazing time and can't wait to be back!"

The bed was comfortable and it was easy to get to my different destinations from her home. The furthest I needed to park was just around the corner one evening, which was only about 1/4 block away. I would definitely return."
60104,9173434,59058614,2016-01-06,49112328,Bob,"Preston was absolutely wonderful in the process of booking, hosting, and following up with this rental. I would definitely recommend this property to anyone who is looking to stay in a cozy home within a reasonable location between downtown Denver and Denver International. Every amenity thinkable was included and the home was spotless upon arrival. Plenty of space to fit a comfortable group of eight. Our group will definitely repeat business if anyone of us ever return to Denver. Thanks again for the wonderful experience! "

48720,7843605,128138191,2017-01-22,106814956,Stephanie,Great location with restaurants in walking distance. Stayed here to be near the convention center which was a quick uber ride away (around $7 each way).  Cynthia was quick to respond to any question/concern.  Since it is downstairs...if someone is upstairs it can become loud very easily but quiet hours were enforced when this occurred which was helpful.  Great stay.
232149,33391273,536915727,2019-09-27,209332070,Gabrielle,"Very inviting, cozy yet spacious  beautiful home! We couldn't have been happier.  Cleanest rental I have ever stayed.

216763,29488638,352045208,2018-11-24,161993537,April,Right away Lynn responded and was able to accommodate my party. the place was more than I expected and Lynn's putactuality and kindness was a pleasant surprise. theres not really a yard or anything like that for ur dog but honestly the amenities and convenience and comfortability of the rest of the place makes up for lack of yard. and it's got an AMAZING patio. it is in the alley way but its separated w a privacy fence and covered w a big ol umbrella. it's a great place to chill out and have a few drinks. would totally recommend Lynn's place. 2 thumbs up for sure

48588,7843605,53880906,2015-11-14,16687032,Shannon,I stayed at Cynthia's place while attending a conference in Denver. The location was perfect and the place was just as described! Cynthia made sure that everything was perfect from start to finish. I even had to call her one night after a parking hiccup and she immediately answered and helped me tremendously. I would definitely stay here again!
120021,17044680,225880940,2018-01-07,85945260,Chris,Annabelle and Christian’s place was lovely and they were very responsive and accommodating. They have great recommendations for things to do and places to eat. And their place is in a great location too! Highly recommend.

211272,28556261,363937867,2018-12-29,6688804,Ian,"DO NOT STAY HERE. 

Too many reasons to list, but here is a quick list:

1) Host does not live in the apartment, which is illegal in Denver
2) While looking through the empty cabinets and drawers looking for coffee we found a letter threatening to evict the host for installing a key-locker without permission...
3)...the key-locker is IMPOSSIBLE to find...
4)...and the building is right next door to a homeless shelter, so finding the key-locker at night is a terrifying ordeal. Prepare to be accosted and screamed at.
5) The homeless shelter next door left plenty of people fighting and yelling outside the building all night long, making a good night's rest impossible.

Just don't stay here. Pay a little more money and find a different place. It's not worth it."
144311,20211505,232412755,2018-02-04,36367383,Danielle,"Leon's place was wonderful! We stayed there with one other couple on our first visit to Denver and it was the perfect amount of space for the four of us. We loved the decor, the place was immaculately clean and provided us with everything we needed. We didn't have a rental car but it was only a 10 min uber/lyft ride to anywhere we wanted to go in the city, and we walked to a few of the spots nearby (highly recommend Sunny's and El Jefe). Would definitely stay here again!"

137498,19387026,330476901,2018-09-30,45388233,Ena,"This was a one of the best Airbnb experiences. I stayed with Heather for a month. She has a lovely house, a beautiful garden and three wonderful pets. We shared experiences, ideas and daily events. She is a great cook and offered me delicious meals made from fresh produce from the garden. Her pup Falcor is adorable and made my stay extra special by being so loving and friendly . It was like living at home! I would totally recommend her as a host!"
153089,21028558,405789418,2019-01-27,110208827,Kimberly,This home was AMAZING! It was much more than we expected. We were on a family mini vacation and there were 7 of us and 3 children. We arrived before check in and Michele was great about letting us check in early. The home was everything you see in the pictures and then some. We all had our own space. It was snowing and our host was gracious enough to shovel snow for us so we didn't have to. They offered tips on local restaurants. We were 7 minutes from downtown and near a grocery store. We grilled (yes in the snow) and we played family games that were provided by Michele and Chaz. We loved our stay and look forward to visiting again soon. This truly was a 5 star home and visit to Denver! Thank you Michele and Chaz for making our trip a success! We appreciate it!
32263,4951295,47845766,2015-09-21,20937333,Kelly,"Christiane, her daughter, and her 2 dogs were so kind and welcoming the moment we arrived (especially after 2 very long days of driving across country).  As a dog owner myself, I really appreciated the acceptance and freedom of allowing us to have our dog with us; it can be really difficult when traveling with your dog and Christiane was extremely accommodating.  

The apartment itself was beautiful and exactly what we needed and how she describes it.  Private and I loved Christiane's attention to the details. Everything from the artwork, local toiletries she provided, local bacon flavored chocolate at the bedside, to the stocked fridge of breakfast food for our long stay while we apartment hunted was so unnecessary and extremely thoughtful of her.  And the location was killer and extremely walk-able.  I could live at this place lol!  Thank you again for such a warm welcome to Denver Christiane!"
12644,1733052,170414487,2017-07-15,116455536,Melissa,"Perfect fit for our needs, walking distance to Chessman park and Colfax. Jason and Vibeke were welcoming as well as accomendating. We enjoyed their invitation to hang out and visit on their patio as well. Great people, great place, great stay! "

116089,16582485,212384021,2017-11-17,2475385,Doug,"Cindy was a fantastic host and went out of her way to correct some check-in issues. The apartment is in a nice location for access to the trains, downtown and riding city bikes along the river. The apartment complex and tenants were quiet but the trains were indeed very loud. They didn't bother me much after the first night however and I enjoyed being just out of the busier parts of downtown. The Poke/Ramen place downstairs is excellent, I'd stay again just to go there."

The bathroom is really nicely redone and I had great showers and even a relaxing bath after a long conference day. The bed is comfortable. The location is a short walk over to downtown, and while you do have to cross US 70 to do so, there are plenty of well marked crosswalks. The light rail system is close by. Thanks Mike for a great stay!"

Lots of parking out front and I felt safe leaving my belongings. LaMark was very helpful and not over communicative with the guests who prefer to just have some alone time. There’s also a great selection of snacks in kitchen! My wife and I enjoyed our stay in Denver and it was nice to have a cozy home away from home to come back to at the end of hot day full of city adventures.

 in including a awesome Grateful Dead Bar named Sancho's Broken Arrow. Enjoyed  my stay here. "
191134,25027450,490519540,2019-07-18,105115928,Alicia,This is a great house. It was really easy to check in and was very clean and organized. The outdoor spaces were cool and great for drinking coffee in the morning! If we’re back in Denver we’ll definitely book again.
1652,56185,305728368,2018-08-11,10454911,Tanya,"Kate's place is amazing; it's certainly the best airbnb I've stayed in. Her house is impeccably decorated and there are thoughtful touches everywhere--from a basket of toiletries from her previous trips (shampoos, lotions, etc.), to an abundance of pillows and blankets and seating space, it was comfort at every corner. We came in August and Kate's garden was in full bloom. Kate generously let us eat from the garden, so we ate fresh berries, tomatoes, peaches, and cucumbers every day! It was a real treat, especially for my toddler who loved to eat blackberries for breakfast. Kate's style is also evident throughout the house; if I could hire her as an interior decorator, I would. If you're looking for somewhere comfy and cozy, with every amenity you could want (including the best luxurious bathtub in the basement), look no further! I would definitely stay here again next time we're in Denver."

The beds were comfy, the bathroom is huge, and the place was clean as can be!  Although we did not use the backyard, it was set up very nicely with grills, chairs, and mood lighting."

It’s easy and fast to travel to other parts of the city. If you are longing a trip to the mountains the highways are all close by and easy to navigate. 

Joanne quickly responded to all our questions and checked in to make sure everything was going great. 

I highly recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit all the amazing things happening in the city and mountains. "

We ended up having the porch door lock behind us, so make sure the latch is up if you go out. After sending a message, help arrived within 20 minutes. There is a tv but it does not get any channels, so I recommend bringing an HDMI device. The place was about 30 min from downtown and the airport. I would definitely stay here again."

170633,22530843,296793155,2018-07-26,75014853,Sarah,im's place was more than we expected! The Townhouse was in a great location.. within walking distance to Sprouts- we loved getting to pick up a few groceries to make breakfast in the mornings. Tim also left a list of local favorites that we took advantage of-Tacos Jaliscos was a huge hit!  The Check -in process was incredibly easy which was a relief after a long day of travel . We could not have found a better place for this price in this location and will keep this in mind for our future Denver Travels Thanks again Tim!

103472,15271643,494092611,2019-07-23,28710550,Carolyn,"Gene and his artist son David were very hospitable! The healthy breakfast spread was above and beyond and the bathroom amenities were great! The Queen bed was super comfy. Additionally, the space itself was very interesting, a 1905 building with exposed brick and high ceilings, as well as the art studio on the grand floor. David was painting while I ate breakfast. Very cool space for art, architect and city lovers, as it’s walking distance to great restaurants. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
139597,19548421,540004398,2019-10-02,284343395,Alex,"Stefani’s place was amazing! Really clean, well lit, great location and really well organized. The place is close to everything you would want to do in Denver. No more then a 10 minutes drive or a 5 minutes walk. It does get loud upstairs from time to time but other then that I highly recommend you pick Stefani’s place."
143175,19988833,230695282,2018-01-28,109208065,Brett,Morgan's place was exactly as described in a cute neighborhood across the street from Regis University. Just a 10 minute ride from downtown Denver and a 20 minute walk from Tennyson Street shopping.

There was plenty of street parking. And the apartment was very clean. Highly recommend staying here if you are coming to Denver. 
21742,3487191,218260036,2017-12-11,3534635,Eric,"I've stayed in Nathen's Carriage House several times now. Never a disappointment. Clean, great location, walking distance from great restaurants, bars and easy Uber into downtown."
67310,10266757,159358701,2017-06-10,62025278,Anika,"Jim's place was great. It was very clean and comfortable. The bed was so cozy! It looked just the way it did in the listing. We had no issues with the location. However, I have heard it might not be the best area to walk around in at night. His place is located very close to Larimer Street, 16th street mall, RiNo art district, and downtown. About a $7 Uber ride to any of those places. There was plenty of street parking right outside of his place. The keyless entry to the carriage house was really great. 

Jim was a great host. He was easy to communicate with and was quick to respond. His friend, Jenny, helped out with some hosting duties since he was out of town for a few days. Jenny was just as awesome. We did have a couple issues with the hot water. However both issues were resolved in a timely matter. Both Airbnb and Jenny were really helpful with this matter. 

I would highly recommend Jim's place to others."

Highly recommended

76409,12276698,340369945,2018-10-23,121098578,Katherine,"Vincent’s home is great place for visitors to stay, whether they intend to make day trips to the mountains or tour Denver. It is extremely easy and quick to Uber downtown from this location.

The home is just as pictured. It is tastefully decorated throughout. It is very nice to come to after a long day having fun in Denver. A  big L-shaped comfortable sofa in the den with a wall- mounted tv and cable service is great. There is also a large tv in the master bedroom with cable. We stayed 5 nights here and were much more comfortable than if we had stayed in a hotel. 

We are looking forward to staying with Vincent again in the future."

Her guide around the neighborhood was a lifesaver when we needed options to explore. We greatly appreciated the abundance of space warmers; they kept us pretty cozy. The WiFi’s fast, shower’s hot, and house is warm. What’s not to love?"

Many light bulbs not working inside and trash around the premise, but everything else was great.  Would definitely stay again."

If you’re going on a weekend I would suggest you check out your options first."

It's in a quite and safe neighborhood with great restaurants within walking distance. We felt very safe coming and going no matter the time of day and parking was always easy to find. Larry was a great host and very prompt with his responses. My best airbnb find yet!

205301,27455846,435891458,2019-04-11,69419739,Jesse,Such a great spot in Denver in the Rino District. Close enough to walk to lots of amazing food and beverage spots. Quick rides to and from the convention center too but far enough out of the city to be quiet. Very cool space!
238134,35454189,547173715,2019-10-14,5152429,Melissa,"This home is in a great location (not far from airport or downtown Denver), and is perfect for large groups.  It's got several bedrooms and bathrooms, and has an open layout and great lounge/game area downstairs.  Plus, it's a great cost for the space!

Our group only a few issues.  First, we were not able to stream any television shows/movies because the smart TV was experiencing an issue with connection.  We did not realize until it was late at night and we were all gathered to hang out and relax, so that was a little disappointing.  Second, there is a discrepancy with the check-out times: the online information stated check out is at 10am and the laminated sheet inside the home has 11am. When we realized this the evening before we were to check out,  I contacted the hosts. I did not receive a reply until 9:45am, and it said we had to be out by 10am.  I had to ask a few times for the hosts to honor the 11am check out time before we were informed that would be fine."
163866,21828418,258697325,2018-04-29,53223333,Jordan,This home was wonderful. It is in the perfect location! It is a 5 minute walk from Root Down and a 10 minute walk from Linger and Little Man Ice Cream. The home looks just like the pictures and Gretchen was so responsive and helpful! She goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome! We fell in love with Denver and will definitely be back and staying here again!
5113,665622,47031389,2015-09-15,32778198,Mary,It was a prefect location. The location was walking distance of night life and restaurants. I felt at home in this apartment.  The place had all the essentials. We only had to buy food and boooze but they had everything else.

Seul inconvénient beaucoup de bruit car le logement est le sous sol d'une maison.

167040,22149209,402186713,2019-01-17,105890956,Jose,"This property is amazing, my family and I took a trip to Denver not knowing what to expect. When we arrived at this property we were amazed. Jason Is an amazing host during our recent trip to Denver Colorado. Not only was the home an amazing place located in a great neighborhood but it was more than we expected. Jason went out of his way to ensure our stay was comfortable and provided a lot of amenities that made the home feel just like our home. Thru out the house every detail was thought of, from the minute we walked into the home we were amazed with the house. Everything you can need was made available. We highly recommend this host and property."

Kitchen had all the appliances we needed especially that we were traveling with an infant and a five year old who are used to eat home cooked food. Kristin was very responsive to any communications. We will definitely stay in this house again when we visit Denver next time..."
70943,11192056,103134207,2016-09-20,68530211,Shannon,Kinga was great! She met us upon arrival and  made sure we had everything  we needed. The apartment is very comfortable and beautifully decorated. And Kinga's Lounge downstairs was a great stop for cocktails and traditional Polish food. 
142593,19893591,489961555,2019-07-17,93751502,Rachel,We were in town for a concert at Red Rocks. This space was perfect for my husband and I to relax afterward. The dining recommendations were very helpful.

159424,21486523,456877219,2019-05-22,42229713,Eric,"Great location and good value. The shower and kitchenette were surprisingly nice for being a tiny house. Check in was easy and all around a pretty good stay. Couple of minor things that kept it from being prefect. The bed isn't the best. It is a fairly comfortable queen bed, but the bed frame it is on seemed flimsy and was super loud making it hard to sleep. There also wasn't really any place to sit comfortably other than the bed. As I said, the bathroom and kitchen were very nice, but would have appreciated some extra towels. All things said, if you are looking for a reasonably priced place near bars, breweries, and restaurants, this is definitely worth a look."

133417,18841778,328578890,2018-09-26,143291538,Taylor,"Michael was a great host and made the process very simple for checking in, getting settled into your room, and checking out! His home is in a good location as well, it doesn't take long to get most places in Denver. It also stood out to me his attention to detail, each guest will have their own towels and rags upon arrival. There is also a shampoo and soap dispenser in the shower, and I thought that was nice to have."
64486,9731001,123758903,2016-12-30,43382435,Charly,Tim and their family are super sweet! Kind and chill energy. Is definitely a kid type house; their daughter played with my dogs a bit. The Grandma of the house was very nice as well. Much appreciated stay!
113824,16304484,123121243,2016-12-27,17254561,Sara,"We had a great stay at Ryan's place. It is a very nice studio apartment with everything you need to feel at home. 
The neighborhood is nice and safe. There is a couple of coffee shops and breakfast places within walking distance. It's really easy to get to the apartment by public transportation.
Ryan was great with communication and helpful, so check in process was uneventful. 
I would stay here again! "
53721,8474753,126794400,2017-01-14,62453733,John,Highly recommend staying here if you are in need of a place to stay in Denver. Very clean and well maintained. Liked having a separate entrance so we didn't disturb the host.

Along with the great house Ahmed was a great host and very helpful. I would definitely recommend a stay at this location! "
82473,13059132,96608489,2016-08-23,70980249,Eric And Jess,"Calling this a carriage house is a tad misleading – it's a converted one-car garage. It is nicely done and a super cute, but the pictures and description make it feel more spacious than it actually is. The space is probably perfect for a young couple but any more than two would be pushing it. Location can't be beat and the host was quick to get back to us when we encountered a minor plumbing issue during our stay. "
138455,19436429,414469021,2019-02-19,20652745,Kelli,"Even better in person! Impeccably clean home with luxurious bath towels and a cozy firepit. Centrally located in a cute neighborhood. Emmy and Cameron were awesome, even making sure the snow was shoveled while being mindful of our privacy. Definitely Superhosts!"
56779,8800911,275209516,2018-06-10,137565886,Kristin,Danny and Christy's renovated church is such a unique place to stay. It is gorgeous inside and so nicely finished. It is in a great location which made it easy to explore Denver!
160960,21662483,479983182,2019-07-01,129801845,Kristin,Claire's cozy apartment is beautifully designed and the perfect home base for travelers who are going to be on the go a lot and need a comfortable place to come back to at the end of the day.  The shared yard is great for people traveling with dogs - definitely a pet friendly spot!  Grateful for Claire's quick responses and graciousness when we needed to change our plans.
165244,21924212,553668910,2019-10-24,300543705,Anita,Joy’s home is amazing. It has everything you need. It is very clean and feels like home. Joy was easy to communicate with. Perfect host and place to stay.

She has composed an extremely relaxing and supportive space with a thoughtful array of amenities.  The location offers easy access to nearby parks, museums, gardens and downtown.  Well done!"
124108,17462656,544692644,2019-10-10,299059063,Steven,Stayed here for a week long business conference.  This is a great place to stay that is between the city center and the park/zoo area.  The area is by an hospital and felt very safe.    Would recommend for business trips versus some of the 'cookie-cutter' hotels downtown!
239993,36419998,531538754,2019-09-17,49028839,Daniel,Cozy and quaint in a great neighborhood. Thanks for havin me.
141382,19786959,326209766,2018-09-21,50935084,Monique,The pictures are SPOT ON!!! This truly is in the perfect location! My friend and I stayed here on a girls getaway and enjoyed walking everywhere because the weather was absolutely perfect all 3 nights! I will echo everyone else on parking...once you get a good spot just don't move the car! :)
233732,33832772,484850355,2019-07-09,118455916,Michael,"Host communicates all information clearly and quickly, and is very accommodating to guests’ needs. Space is nice and clean!"

216533,29464543,357245031,2018-12-09,31612284,Charlie,"This was with out a doubt one of the BEST places we have ever stayed on Air BnB! Incredibly cleanly, wonderful decor, beautiful part of town, convenient part of town, and a fabulous host who puts so much forethought into her guests stay, it's like you were staying back home. Ann's place has more hospitality and amenities than any main stream hotel! We will 100% book again when we stay in Denver! 


This is a golden nugget of a find, I cant speak highly enough about it! 

You will not be disappointed!"
138890,19501629,171048960,2017-07-16,7281988,Reana,"Don't let the basement aspect discourage you, this unit is a lovely home away from home with everything you could possibly need! You'll have tons of space here, an ample kitchen if you plan to cook, a luxe bathroom and tub situation, beautiful living room space, and a suuuper comfy bed. I didn't meet Brooke or Sarah, but the communication was pretty good and I had no problem accessing the unit on my own. 

When they say parking is difficult, they are NOT kidding! I would strongly suggest not driving if you stay here. It is easy to walk into the downtown area (I walked nearly every day) and you can also get an affordable car service if needed. Something else to be aware of is that you'll traverse a narrow passageway to the entrance, and also have a steep staircase to deal with getting into the unit - a bit of a challenge if you have tons of luggage or aren't great at hauling stuff on your own. 

I really enjoyed my time in this cozy space, thanks Brooke!"
216675,29478132,404341297,2019-01-23,24419949,Lauren,"Highly recommend this Airbnb when staying in Denver. First off, it’s beautifully decorated yet cozy and comfortable. Sam was super communicative and check in/out was a breeze. It’s in a great (and safe) location, super close to bars and restaurants. Overall, wonderful experience and will definitely stay here again next time we’re in town!"
48245,7817254,64273409,2016-03-01,43447691,Eddie,"Will and his girlfriend made this one of my best AirBnB experiences to date. The home was clean and friendly. The room was exactly as advertised and clean and organized. I had everything at my disposal, including a home cooked meal that was delicious. 
The hospitality of this couple was amazing. I absolutely loved everything. Very cool people and their funny and loving dog, Hudson. 

I highly recommend this AirBnB stay."

Her place is equipped with a washer/dryer and so many amenities that made our stay really fun and comfortable!  She also gave us some tips about what to see locally.  You will not be disappointed!"

31868,4895802,446106512,2019-04-30,173192050,Sally,"We love this property! The location is excellent. Walking distance to all sorts of shopping and restaurant choices. The space is super clean and has all the amenities one would need. We especially loved that the two bedrooms are on opposite sides of the loft - lots of privacy and low noise if other guests are early risers.  Hosts are quick to respond with any questions, and check-in/out was a breeze. The pedestrian bridge right out the front door is extremely convenient and opens up even more possibilities for food, shopping, city parks and more.  The patio is a plus for taking in a great view of the city. The off-street parking space for our rental car was a huge bonus and convenience.  We highly recommend this property for your stay in Denver!"

80328,12932332,489383279,2019-07-16,354530,Kate,"Loved our downstairs hideaway. Comfy, clean, and blissfully cool during some brutally hot summer days.
Easy access with keypad on back door. Had room in fridge to keep all our perishable food. There's a coffee maker and a teapot in the kitchen, and we were able to use their dishes, cups, and silverware for our meals. 
Location was perfect for us to get to all the places we needed to go during our 4-day stay. Neighborhood is quiet and safe. 
Rich and Shannon are delightful. Really enjoyed our conversations.
Their dog is super well behaved. Never barked or begged or pawed. 
Highly recommend this gem!"

We had an amazing time and enjoyed all the great bar, brewery, and restaurant options the area had to offer. Also, downtown was a quick trip away. We had a great experience and recommend this to anyone looking for a nice and comfortable place."

21759,3487191,267781310,2018-05-22,187356605,Tim,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the carriage house during out recent trip to Denver, and we’re so glad we did. Nathen and Alicia are amazing hosts. Great communication, tips, and direction for whats around. House was clean and well furnished. Plenty of clean towels and sheets. Amenities were great! Will definitely be back next time we’re in Denver. 

Close to lots of shops and dining on Broadway and more stuff to the west on Santa Fe. Short drive pretty much anywhere in the metro area. We had a blast staying here. Definitely recommend!

(Also, we rented a car and that was probably the best idea for Denver. Off street parking available, park right next to the carriage house.)"
160521,21608586,464868084,2019-06-06,1846393,Rhiann,Exactly as advertised. Perfect crash pad for my work trip to Denver.

The neighborhood was very safe and so quiet that we could sleep with the window open all night and you could hear a pin drop. The location is perfect because you're so close to all the great things that Denver has to offer. Paul was so warm and welcoming, by the end of our stay it felt like we were family.  Next time my fiancé and I are in Denver, Paul's place will be the first place we'll try to book!"

When we ran into bad weather and had to cancel one night unexpectedly Andy was understanding and worked out a refund with us.  Its so evident he loves to host as everything was cute and he was friendly and full of suggestions. Would recommend!!"

The outdoor space was perfect for hanging out after trips, and eating breakfast each morning. The location is perfect for walking or a quick drive to some awesome restaurants, bars, cafes, shopping etc. All the nature spots we wanted to check out were an hour or less away. It was literally the perfect home base for this Colorado adventure. Becca was easy and pleasant to communicate with and had good suggestions for things to do in the area.  We could not be happier with our choice to stay here. Thank you Becca!"

188885,24684368,352103795,2018-11-24,5529636,Gus,"This is an excellent Airbnb home! Firstly, this is one of the cleanest homes we've ever been in anywhere...ever. Always nice to find this level of attention in a rental. Secondly, there were bagels, bread, juice, apples etc. in the kitchen when we arrived. That was a first for us in an Airbnb. Really welcoming. (Thanks, Julia!) Thirdly, the decor is fairly minimalist with a retro/futuristic style. We really thought it was well executed and fun. This is always one of the things we enjoy about Airbnb homes is the opportunity to live with a different kind of decor from your own home. The beds are very comfortable with nice linens and plenty of towels in the bathrooms. By the way, the master bath has a shower as well. The kitchen was one of the best outfitted that we've seen. My wife baked two pies for Thanksgiving here without issue. There's a Keurig with a variety of K-cups. Plenty of pots and pans and good appliances. Every cabinet in the kitchen is labeled with contents! How much time do spend looking for things in an unfamiliar place? Not here. We didn't spend a lot of time here as we were visiting family nearby. We would have loved to hang out in the backyard barbequing or have a cocktail on the front porch with the cool curvy wall. Highly recommend this Atom Punk house!"

We enjoyed the proximity to Washington Park, walking to dinner in several different directions, sitting the patio in the morning drinking coffee and just strolling the neighborhood. The beds were comfortable and the house well suited for visitors. We'll come back the next time we're in Denver."

117941,16825395,162890973,2017-06-22,20086934,Lisa,My friends and I were very happy staying here!  I was a little nervous we might be to crowded (there were 6-7 of us) but there was PLENTY of space here.  Furniture was perfectly chosen to have enough seating/beds for a larger group without being obtrusive if you don't need them.  The house looks tiny and cute from the outside but spacious inside.  Very clean.  Ericka was super friendly and welcoming.  I was also personally very excited to be in walking distance of the vegan grocery store.  We would definitely stay here again!

About 10 minute walk to the hot part of the Highlands (very trendy), about 20 min walk to downtown Denver. The linens are very comfortable - better than my sheets at home. Alena has stocked the kitchen with tons of utensils and there is coffee and creamer for people to use! There is only one shower, but it worked just fine for my trip (7 girls on a bachelorette party).  Overall, the house was a great stay!"
190301,24848902,488180809,2019-07-14,161177269,Kelly,Nice home for a large group! The upstairs patio was a nice surprise and the beds were comfortable.

John (your host) is very nice and seems easy-going and flexible. He provides all the necessities for a really good stay.
Also the backyard seems like it's a realllllllly great place to hang out in the warmer months.
Enjoy your stay!!"

Awesome stay!"
202665,26892494,428216380,2019-03-24,78015440,Kimdona,"This place was great! It was very clean and exactly as pictured. Keep in mind that this space is at the top of several flights of stairs, so if you physically cannot climb stairs, it may be an issue. My only concern with this space were the doors leading out to the deck area—as it wouldn’t shut all the way, and thus not being able to lock. Overall, a lovely space! I would recommend."

The property was exactly as shown- clean, spacious and very comfortable. Very nice bedrooms and full kitchen as well. Great communication, the host greeted us and showed us how to use the keypad entry, as well as showing us the space and some pointers of getting around Denver.
The location was ideal close to everything , just as advertised. Walking distance to lake w/ geese , which my girls loved!!  The host provided great communication but gave us plenty of privacy.

You can hear footsteps and other noises from upstairs but it didn’t really bother us at all.  The neighborhood is super cute as well. I would definitely stay at Mark’s place again.

Maureen was extremely accommodating and patient in allowing us to make our decision. The accommodations were even better then we had expected. Very spacious modern, clean and stocked with all the appliances you could possibly need. The kitchen was a delight to cook in.  All three beds were comfortable and we loved the neighborhood. The dogs were really friendly. I look forward to staying here again."

The apartment had plenty of space for me and my friend. Ryan was in regular communication before and during our staying, making sure we had everything we needed. We were out and about most of the time, but the time we did spend there was enjoyable.  Would stay again!"

The neighborhood was nice and I felt safe to be out at night. I never saw Adrienne as I was coming and going, but possibly heard her upstairs just a little bit so you definitely have your privacy if you’re concerned about that. The only think I didn’t care for was the door that was connected to the upper level, but it wasn’t even an issue during my stay. Staying here helped make my vacation stress free, which is greatly appreciated!!!"

The place was super clean which is very important to me and I loved having access to a washer and drier. This place really brings true meaning to the phrase “Sharing is caring”. Not only do other guests leave behind 420 goodies but when we arrived there was water, unopened alcohol and unopened snacks left behind for others to enjoy ! My bf loved his stay so much that he wants to make Liz’s place our go to for our Denver stay. The location was also perfect as we were close to pretty much everything we needed ! A few recommendations I’d like to share include Adrift, Denver Buiscuit Co, Fat Sully’s, and The Budlong Hot Chicken. Thanks again Liz "

He was very informative and had lots of suggestions of places we should visit before we left Denver. There is nothing better than coming home to a hot tub after a long day of hiking. Overall, I was thrilled with my visit and would definitely recommend staying at Jeffs house. He is very accommodating and reliable. "

This place was prefect for when my girlfriend and I need to regroup after exploring. The house has two rooms the one we stayed in was across the bathroom and it was very spacious. The bed was cozy and the a/c unit in the room was great since it was very hot when we visited Denver. The kitchen was clean and the freezer had ice. We enjoyed that there was a coffee machine and fresh ground coffee available for use. We would definitely stay here again.

110900,16037872,363426626,2018-12-28,5677413,Toria,"Jess is a wonderful host and her place is in an ideal location - especially if you are only in town for a few days. There are so many great restaurants, bars, grocery shops, etc., just steps away. Unfortunately, my husband was battling a cold/flu during our entire stay so we spent more time at home and in bed than anticipated. With that said, the bed was not very comfy overtime. My only suggestion would be to replace the mattress as it tends to sink in the middle which is not ideal for a couple sharing it."
32926,5070640,112326632,2016-11-05,47283186,Eli,"The carriage house was beyond perfect. Andrea does an excellent job of communicating and ensuring that you will have everything you might need while you stay. My wife and I were very pleased with comfy bed and sofa, furnished kitchen, and extra amenities like fresh fruit, extra towels, and post cards. It was easily accessible and entering the home was a breeze. The neighborhood was great and felt extremely safe. We enjoyed all the restaurants and shops within walking distance. When we return to Denver, we will definitely be staying at Andrea's place. We highly recommend the carriage house!

You have an opportunity to meet so many different people from different parts of the world. Everyone who I interacted with was wonderful and charming! The atmosphere is top notch! Free espresso and plenty of nooks to get lost in with a good book. The jacquizzi was an awesome way to finish my stay. The dorms are so private and comfortable. I have nothing but praise for Ember!

The place was perfect for a couple, in a great neighborhood with plenty of coffee and breweries within walking distance."

6071,746298,88727918,2016-07-25,45817059,Patti,"I loved my month long stay with Buffy. After learning that I was looking to buy a condo in the area, she shared so much information about the neighborhood and even invited me along to a neighborhood get together.  She was very easy going and quite generous with sharing all parts of her home.  I especially appreciated all the tourist information and guide books she shared.  Her eclectic style and knowledge of the local art scene was a constant delight.  She will definitely be seeing me again in the future.  "

Lyft’s from the place were inexpensive, there were many amenities in the bathroom and kitchen, everything was extremely tidy and clean - no negative things to say about this lil home. Very cute spot!"
155583,21151336,431301036,2019-03-31,110665107,Jonathan,Great basement apartment in a fantastic location.  The only problem was the noise from upstairs.  If you are sensitive to noise pick a different location.  Otherwise this is a fantastic apartment in a great location.  Easy walk to the botanical garden and city park.

32429,4964614,82810191,2016-06-29,54743543,Tanya,"I really enjoyed staying in this mansion. It’s in a lovely neighborhood with beautiful historic homes and tree-lined streets. The balcony is a wonderful place to relax and watch the world go by. Linda furnished and decorated the house so well! She stayed in touch before and during my stay even though she was out of town. She also gave excellent restaurant recommendations. The bed and sheets were comfortable, and Linda left plenty of towels and toiletry items in the bathroom to use. Overall, this was a wonderful stay, and I can't speak highly enough about it!"

We will definitely come back!"
22204,3605358,33009255,2015-05-24,5200531,Kay,"This was our first aurbnb experience and we couldn't have been happier. Georgia was so accommodating, meeting us 4 hours later than planned because of flight delays. She had a bottle of wine waiting for us because she knew we had a rough day.

Her home is a treasure in a restored mansion in Capitol Hill. Our room was spacious and very comfortable. We had off-street parking, which is really important in this part of Denver. 

The location is perfect for walking to restaurants, shops, and museums.

There was always coffee and something set out for us to nibble on in the morning. Georgia went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. We highly recommend staying here.
"
66640,10237203,83404094,2016-07-02,14361415,Rachel,"We came in late and left early, but Jess's private suite was a welcome and cozy place to sleep after a late night flight. The space was spotless and the bed was comfy. We both LOVED the shower! Great water pressure and plush towels to wash off that post-travel feeling. 

One word of caution for late sleepers: we did hear kids running around upstairs early (around 8am). Wasn't a problem for us since we were up already."

76300,12276698,146161671,2017-04-21,102498965,Jennifer,"Vincent was super great and the home is beautiful. Its is located right down the street form downtown (4mim drive from capital hill). It is close to an intersection and school, but the area was nice a lively not at all disturbing. Lots of really nice people to make conversation with. Tons of space inside, we cooked all of our meals (kitchen is set up for anything you might need), and Vincent was very accomodating. We had a party of 5 and he made sure we had all the blankets, towels, and breakfast fixings we needed.
This was our first Air bnb experience and we will definitely stay in touch and be back to stay with him again. 
Take advantage of this wonderful deal/experience!"
80880,12972487,112521739,2016-11-06,26481623,Ashlee,"This place is perfection. Tonya was a wonderful host with great communications. Myself, husband and 3yr old had a 3 day Colorado trip. 2 days in the mountains and our last night at the Retro Pad. The moment we arrived we wished we had more time there. Pictures don't capture how roomy it is. There was so much for all of us to do. We played Croquet in the back yard, little one watched movies and read books while we played Yahtzee. Had late lunch at Esther's per recommendation. Artisan pizza and craft beer? Yes please! 

We make this an annual trip, and will be staying here again!

Ps- Tonya, I need that lemon cookie recipe!"
48021,7790834,97240306,2016-08-26,53738117,Katie,"I loved this place so much and Sam was a wonderful hostess!
Accuracy: the inside is exactly as pictured and so perfect! The outside is not quite as green as the picture but it is still really cute and well kept!
Cleanliness: Extremely clean!
Arrival: Sam made the arrival super easy. She gave me a code to a little thing that houses the key. I did have a little trouble with the contraption but that was 100% operator error.
Amenities: everything was wonderful. She has little notes with tips on everything throughout the unit. The bedroom has a fan which was a major plus for me and there is a wall air conditioning unit, should you need it.
Communication: Sam was so on top of it. I had trouble with the lock and texted her and she was down in seconds to help me open the door and then switched out my key because she said it was easier.
Location: the neighborhood is so cool! Very nice and safe. All the houses are well kept and there literally are probably 20 restaurants and bars and things within a couple mile radius of here.
Value: excellent value for the quality of the unit, the space, the location and of course, the wonderful hostess!!
Thanks so much for the stay, Sam! Next time I will be in Denver, I will see if this unit is available!"
46886,7592378,110356970,2016-10-25,10384838,Oscar,"Colleen's place was amazing. Plenty of space for me and my friend. Only wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the gym/spa. Her place is two blocks away from a city bike rack, which we bought a 24hr ride for $9 and went all over the city. Felt very secure with my vehicle left in the garage with all my gear. "

My flight was at a crazy time, and she was flexible with my checking in, which was greatly appreciated. Bed is comfy, bathroom is attached right to room (and more importantly, so clean), and check-in is easy. I’d recommend Stephanie’s place to anyone wanting a nice private room in Denver, and/or near the airport."

Really easy to get to with public transportation. The bus stop is across the street. Late nite Lyft was reasonable. Zak even provided an airport run for a nominal fee.  Friendliness and convenience are the best parts, after Biscuit of course."

The room is simple, spacious, and has everything you need. Restaurants and grocery store is 20-25 minute walk. Lyft to the airport was about 15$. I stayed here while I had an overnight layover and it was perfect."

The place is SUPER clean and well outfitted to stay in. It has so much great character and touches. We loved the smell of the Xmas tree, the lights and the rest of the decorations. The bathroom and shower were great. The kitchen had EVERYTHING we needed in it. The bed was super comfortable and the place was spotless. You can tell that Jason and Cate have put so much time into making this place the perfect Airbnb and we will definitely be staying here again! Thanks so much!"

235989,34526761,505763138,2019-08-09,264859605,Justine,"This place was absolutely prefect. Myself, boyfriend, two other friends stayed here and loved everything that was offered. Before arriving, Lawrence reached out to me to know what time we plan on arriving and if we needed anything. He even made an accommodation to let us check in earlier than what was scheduled! Upon arriving, our choice of beers and limes were ready to go for us to enjoy before our concert that night at the red rocks!! It was such a cool personal touch to add to our first night. 

Lawrence and Lance also shared a very helpful guide book around Denver too. We used that to our advantage for going to places to see, eat/drink, and definitely enjoy some good ole Colorado flower! 

Speaking of marijuana, their AirBnB had all the supplies you would need to indulge in the activity. All supplies were included in a nice set up in the living room. We all gathered around the nice and big coffee table to roll up and fill up our bowls. Then we kicked back on the couches to watch movies. The living room was such a perfect way for a group of four to relax before we left for our events and to end the night after a long day. 

The bedrooms were perfect too! The beds were comfy and clean. The closets had so much space to unpack all your things and lay them out throughout the shelves. 

The bathroom was nice and clean too. The waterfall shower was relaxing to shower under. 

The kitchen was supplied with basic kitchen needs/utensils, Keurig, microwave, popcorn, beer, soda, water, and cinnamon rolls!! 

We didn’t get a chance to enjoy the backyard but there was a ton a space. Also, you may run into two very adorable and loving dachshunds! It was such a wonderful surprise. We have two dachshunds at home so it felt nice to get a little puppy interaction while we were on vacation!

I hope anyone that reads this can tell that this is a 6 star AirBnB. You are guaranteed to feel well taken care of and have a great time in Denver because of these two! If/when we come back, this place would definitely be my first choice!"
187162,24452513,266858828,2018-05-20,57337522,Steve,"From bottom to top of the Mountain Goat Home, we thoroughly enjoyed our accommodations. From our arrival to the two car garage located on a securely gated drive, we had peace-of-mind that our vehicles were out of harms way from hailstorms & human distractions that can sometimes ruin an excursion to the city. The ground floor bunkroom is perfect for separating the adult & adolescent groups (our son appreciated his own space and solitude away of the estrogen fueled activities on the floors above). The next level is the gathering place ideally suited for cooking a meal while carrying on conversation with your group, listening to music or catching a movie on the BIG Screen. The thoroughly modern, front load washer & dryer stack (would not mind having appliances similar to these in my own home) on the third floor, sleeping level; are a welcome added convenience to the guest for freshening-up the travel clothes to keeping the towels at the ready for the soak in the spa on the roof top deck. Which, btw, is heavenly; and where we will end our bottom-to-top review of David's Mountain Goat Place peering out at Metro Denver's skyline in the evening with the smells of our kabobs sizzling on the barbie.  Pack your bags and create your own Denver memories, here. Cheers & Safe Travels!"
178678,23467833,459717824,2019-05-27,44120231,Linda,"Pamela was a great host and the location was central to many activities in Denver.  The three bedrooms and their beds were very comfortable, quiet and private. There were two well-equipped bathrooms (one on each floor).  Breakfast food (cereal, yogurt, milk, tea, coffee, variety of breads) was provided, most exceptionally, fresh organic eggs from Pamela's free ranging, sweet hens in her yard.  The kitchen and dining room were well equipped and large.  Plenty of space to make and eat family meals. The living room and upstairs common TV/lounge room had comfy seating and were stylishly decorated.  A variety of teas and coffees (as well as beer and wine for discounted rates) were available on both floors. The house was across the street from the beautiful Denver Botanical Gardens, which had a delicious cafe for lunch and munchies, and a beautiful gift store. Pamela provided a free pass, which saved our family the entrance fees.  Parking was on the street.  Pamela was friendly and easily available and responded immediately to any questions we had.   We were highly appreciative of our stay!"
98623,14787426,331469753,2018-10-02,33706354,Darren,This place is exactly as described.

244403,39059018,559079087,2019-11-03,236195643,Drew,"We enjoyed our stay in this cozy, private, immaculate space. The bedroom was very comfortable and had ample closet space with both shelving & hangers provided. A microwave & mini fridge helped round it out for our vacation needs. We were here in cold weather, and the unit was comfortably warm. Highly recommend this place & look forward to returning on our next stay in CO."
129331,18304991,519467800,2019-08-28,23006241,Elleene And Vic,"Aaron and Mallori's place is lovely! They were quick to respond to our same-day request to book and provided us with a clean and comfortable space. 
Their home is close to downtown, accessible to  highways to the mountains and airport. 
It was exactly what we needed for our short, last minute trip to Denver."

109782,15844892,488924345,2019-07-15,74858955,Lorie,"Daniel's apartment was perfect for my husband and I to have a safe, stylish, very clean, and cozy place to retreat to after our daily adventures in Colorado.  The shower was nice and relaxing and the bed was super comfortable.  The apartment is in a fantastic location - close to grocery, Cheesman Park, and any kind of restaurant you could hope for.  Daniel was incredibly friendly (as were the sweet dogs) and helpful.  He has built a beautiful deck in the backyard, which we enjoyed at various times each day.  It was a perfect experience and we would recommend Daniel's beautiful apartment to anyone visiting Denver."

90334,13751968,301744660,2018-08-04,3248290,Karen,"Nicely decorated. Easy check-in. Not air-conditioned but they have a mobile cooling unit which cooled  the room nicely.

You are right on the city sidewalk, so there is definitely street noise, but it didn't bother us.

Because it is an older building, outlets in the living room and bedroom were a little scarce, so bring and extension cord if you need it. Also, the small bathroom is located off of the living room and it has 2 steep steps up, which takes a bit to get used to.

The unit is centrally located and although you need to park on the street, we didn't have any problems parking.

Thanks for the stay!"
146403,20454442,219455163,2017-12-17,155169823,Tracy,nice place! we had a great stay! it was close to everything and nice view of the mountains and the city :)
34466,5433111,106181154,2016-10-04,86317620,Tara,Todd's place was perfect. Quaint apartment near local bars and restaurants. Short ride in the city  Todd and his wife were welcoming. We felt right at home. I would definitely recommend his place for a couple. Or weekend getaway with your 2 BFFs
180905,23740719,291425385,2018-07-15,91401289,Samantha,There were step by step instructions on how to get in. There was a greeting when we checked in. Kristin was very quick to respond when I would send a message. She gave me pointers on where to go. The place has to be one of my top favorite stays although the location was great walking distance from every local area. There are many homeless around especially around the shelter and one church. We just walked a street further to avoid any uneasiness

Every little thing is thought of and the kitchen is well stocked with tools needed to prepare an amazing meal.   Extra pillows, towels, and a great shower to boot.   The place is perfectly located in the art district, very stylish and Patrick leaves you with every detail needed in his info binder.   It's a shame to only give 5 stars when this place deserves more!!!"

164285,21853722,447498326,2019-05-03,121672511,Cierra & Eve,"I think she already knows how wonderful of a host she is or at least I hope so! Such quick responses for every question we had and ready with the answers and more! Nothing bad to say at all about the place, except that we wish there were more scooters but that’s Lyft’s fault lol. We had a blast with those around Michelles neighborhood, I highly recommend! It was just everything we imagined and her house was the perfect gem to start an incredible trip in Colorado. The neighborhood and surrounding shops and eateries came with an unexplainable atmosphere of great energy and vibes all around! Ive never had such an experience before. Thank you Michelle! Nothing but great things to say about Michelle and her place! We’re excited to plan our next visit to Colorado with her"

It’s very close to downtown and was a comfortable place to stay for a week. The only downside was that I had to parallel park (I live in the suburbs and never have to lol)."
221069,30533048,537446647,2019-09-28,243881432,Julia,"The listing said that this place is able to host 5, but it was hard to even host 4. The futon was pretty uncomfortable for a 3 night stay, and they also didn’t leave out any blankets for the futon other than 2 small blankets. There were only 2 clean full sized towels. The place smelled kind of like ammonia, and the pictures definitely make the place seem a whole lot nicer than it is."

She made us feel like it was actually our home for the duration of our stay.  She answered all of our questions and made our stay and ""check out"" as easy as possible.  The refrigerators were fully stocked with waters and other drinks that she graciously provided for us.  It met all of the expectations that we had.  Thanks Araceli!"

I had so many lovely conversations with him and his tea.. beyond amazing.  It's perfect.  The bed and room itself are wonderful.  The room features a window seat that is so charming.
44201,7199544,288412865,2018-07-09,79148015,Suzanne,"This  idyllic bungalow is perfectly located for a visit to many of Denver’s most renowned restaurants, parks, bike trails, and popular sites, but it is particularly perfect for anyone who wants to be near the University of Denver, which is within walking distance.  Having taken my daughter out to start graduate school and move into an apartment, I found that Rae’s home provided a key base of operations.  We were able to get everywhere we needed to go within minutes – the campus itself, the housing and pristine neighborhoods surrounding campus, the lovely Washington Park shops and restaurants, and Cherry Creek, which happened to have its annual art festival while we were there, an event worth attending even if not in Denver for some other reason. 

Rae’s home was ideal for two people, and would comfortably accommodate three, or maybe four. The Airbnb pictures of the home are lovely but don’t fully capture Rae’s flair for decorating. The house, from living area to bedroom to kitchen is beautifully appointed, and Rae has provided everything one needs for a comfortable stay. The kitchen even has a French press, which allowed us to make coffee the way we do at home. The kitchen tile, the wood floor, the cabinets, the upscale stainless appliances and the bathroom fixtures—all were like new, shiny, and clearly well-taken care of. You can tell the owner loves this place and is meticulous in caring for it; it is super clean from floor to ceiling and corner to corner.  The refrigerator, stove, and dishwasher looked as if they had never been used.  The house itself is in top-notch shape. 

As if the bungalow itself isn’t enough of a treat, it boasts a beautiful, large patio, perfect for a book and coffee in the morning, iced-tea in the afternoon, and wine in the evening. Surrounding the patio is Rae’s wel-tended garden—lots of lush, colorful flowers and plants —such a lovely spot to relax or chat. 

I can’t say enough about this sweet spacious bungalow—tranquil, perfectly situated, convenient, clean, upscale, reasonably priced. It’s an oasis in the middle of a city I didn’t want to leave. I can’t wait to return to Rae’s place. If you are heading to Denver, don’t overlook this gem. "
231219,33196515,479304030,2019-06-30,41175356,Carol,"This house is adorable and in a great location.  In the home, there is a Airbnb in the basement.  That is no problem at all and we actually thoroughly enjoyed them! Shared eateries and things to do with.  Amy is most helpful and we will go back as we enjoyed our stay there.  You’ll love hanging out in the courtyard."
15545,2146050,327395068,2018-09-23,1531402,Bronsky,Ryan's place is  fantastic. Everything was just as described. We had a great time.

86364,13449331,540549346,2019-10-03,106788403,David,"Gary’s accommodation in Sunnyside is absolutely as described if not better. It is in a quiet residential area. There are some lovely touches such as a well stocked coffee machine and some vinyl records to play on a retro record player. 

The check in/ check out procedure couldn’t have been easier. 

Parking for one car was immediately outside the property on the drive. 

Although we didn’t get the chance to use it there is a nice seating area lit up attractively at night outside in the garden. 

Gary recommended Sprouts for stocking up on provisions. It is only a few minutes drive and was one of the most amazing fresh food supermarkets we have been to. Definitely worth going early in the stay to stock up. 

We managed to walk to Downtown Denver which was about 2 miles. Into town it is a pleasant mainly flat/downhill walk. 

We couldn’t fault the property and thank Gary for being an excellent Air BnB host who’s communication was excellent. 

Thanks Gary for making our stay in Denver so enjoyable."

The photos do not do him justice. The apartment fits roughly 6 people snugly, 4 people comfortably, and for 2 people spaciously.  I truly hope the price stays the same because you will get the most of your money by staying here. If this is not your first choice, you would be a fool. The only thing that was missing was some toothpaste which we left behind. I do not have any negative things to say and wish Harold the best of luck with his future bookings. "

The home was organized and decorated very nicely, lots of space, and comfy beds. It's located right on the ""green mile"" close to thousands of dispensaries (im taking walking distance) and just 15 minutes from downtown Denver. It's a pot-friendly home and it was very relaxing. Our only issue during the whole stay was a power outage that lasted for about an hour but overall I'd recommend Dale's place to everyone and will be coming back."
122008,17251698,143620202,2017-04-12,123331310,Rick,great place to stay with a budget. I would recommend this house to anyone.

9674,1042331,95232244,2016-08-18,16815644,Alyssa & Jason,"Annette was very friendly and welcoming. She communicated very well and was full of useful recommendations for the area. We enjoyed the neighborhood and the house was really neat (it is an old, big 1930's house that has been converted into different apartments). It had all the needed amenities and was nicely decorated. My husband and I stayed here for 6 weeks and really enjoyed our stay. We would stay here again and recommend Annette's place!"

24751,3992779,32175775,2015-05-15,1574241,Laura,"Me, my husband, and our sweet dog just stayed 4 days with Elizabeth in Denver. It was awesome! The place is tiny but totally efficient, cozy, clean, quiet, quaint...just great. The temperature was good, the bed was comfortable, the towels were fluffy, all the kitchen utensils were brand new, and the wifi was plentiful. We had a conference downtown but wanted to bring our dog and not pay high Denver hotel prices. This apt was perfectly located just 1.5 miles walk to downtown, 1/2 block to grocery/Einstein bagels/cleaners, 3 blocks to a pub, 6 short blocks to beautiful Cheeseman Park and the members entrance to the Denver Botanical Gardens. Lovely neighborhood, nice neighbors, found street parking every day. Elizabeth is very accommodating and super available (she was home when we arrived; she immediately responds to texts). We are quite and private and this apartment worked! Our dog loved the space, the backyard, the neighborhood, and the residents. I totally recommend staying here for business, pleasure, or just checking out super friendly Denver.  Elizabeth is a really interesting and very nice person. Another great AirBnB experience for us."
110520,15978051,136970984,2017-03-12,17006316,Savannah,"Warm welcome and departure! They were very open and friendly. We ended up sleeping late, and they respected our space and quiet. Perfect place for cannabis fans and those looking for nightlife within walking distance! Would not recommend it for asthmatics or those with smoke allergies. Judith was extremely sweet and had a beautiful, clean space waiting for us, as well as warm hugs!"

4772,662431,416482942,2019-02-24,48187171,Emily,"Had a great stay here in the heart of the Washington Park neighborhood. Street parking is readily available, and the electronic lock makes check in very easy. Studio was impeccably clean and filled with great amenities like coffee, instant oatmeal, a noise machine, and “just in case” toiletries (like the travel hairbrush I snagged). My only complaint (not really a complaint at all) is that it is perilously close to the delicious Bonnie Brae Ice Cream shop. I greatly appreciated waking up to a well-shoveled/salted walkway the morning after a pretty decent snowfall."
132404,18753893,161822086,2017-06-18,82200877,David,Awesome location just outside of downtown and Coors field. Lots of restaurants with in walking distance. Huge house with everything a family would need. Awesome backyard area to BBQ and hang out. Highly recommend the house. Plenty of space for the six adults we had. Could handle double that easy. Couldn't of asked for anything better. Thanks Paige

7804,852934,20810790,2014-10-06,101831,Jenny,"Peaceful Colarado Artists Retreat? one word- Wonderful.
We cannot rate our stay here highly enough, we arrived to a very friendly welcome, a fully stocked fridge and extremely comfortable accommodation. Tom and Viv made us feel completely at home, we had 5 nights and loved it all. The apartment is eclectic but that is what we loved, it was quiet, warm and had all amenities. We spent a great deal of time chatting with Tom and Viv and Tom joined us for a very convivial evening at the local Indian restaurant and gave us a lovely ad hoc tour of Denver when driving us downtown. It was lovely to stay with people who we had complete trust in and who trusted us. The house  is a 15 minute walk or 2 minute drive to Colorado light railway station that will have you downtown in 20 minutes. There is a supermarket and cinema a short drive away.
Highly recommended and we would not hesitate to stay again and totally stress free."
26011,4180622,24683717,2015-01-01,10728389,Suma,"This is one of our best stay through airbnb.. Maureen's apartment is fantastic.. It's new and extremely clean.. And we really liked the fact that Maureen pays attention to details and all the little things.. She certainly had all the cleaning products in place which tells you that the place will be well sanitized before  your stay.. The apartment itself is very cute and we felt right at home for the whole week we stayed.. The apartment has a private one car garage and not to mention just like the home the garage is clean and free of clutter.. The apartment is close to freeways and not a bad drive to ski resorts on hwy 70.. There is a small cute room to store all your ski gear and extra luggage.. I also particularly liked the alarm system in the apartment.. The apartments highlight is a beautiful kitchen which is well equipped..Maureen has well decorated the apartment and it also has loads of games.. the apartment has plenty of natural light and hardwood floors that I love in (Website hidden by Airbnb) and my husband got a chance to talk to Maureen and Carlos, and they are such a lovely couple to chat with.. Also they have 3 dogs which are so well behaved and you will absolutely never hear them bark.. I would highly recommend this apartment"

Simon and Aurora have exceeded all expectations with this extraordinarily clean, beautiful, and inviting space in the heart of Denver. Not only was the place sparkling, but it was absolutely FILLED with the most thoughtful amenities: a pillow bar with several firmness options, local craft beer in the fridge, a gift basket with waters and snacks, toiletries in case of forgetfulness, local coffee to sample, and more. The cottage is full of suggestions for exploring the area and close to everything in Denver, with easy access to the surrounding highways and mountains. Parking is a breeze, and the neighborhood is peaceful. We were never once bothered by a thing. What a relief to return ""home"" each evening to this amazing space! We won't forget it, and we WILL be back! Thank you, Aurora and Simon!"

Location is nice, pretty quiet neighborhood but easy walk to some great restaurants. Uber to downtown was about $8-10 or the light rail was about a 30 min walk. I would definitely stay here again."
222230,30929157,442902059,2019-04-24,96193631,Nicole,Very nice and cute place. Had a lot of small touches that really it made that more comfortable and convenient.

216613,29464543,560427293,2019-11-06,153885161,Kristen,"What an amazing home away from home!  Such a stylish, thoughtfully appointed space with excellent snacks (seriously, the supplied fixings for a PB&J sandwich hit the spot one night!). 

Fantastic location, about a 40-min walk to Union Station, in an excellent and safe neighborhood with tons of chic places to eat and shop (and workout!) nearby. Felt very safe walking there at night and in the home itself (with chain locks and the like on the front door and lots of indoor and outdoor lighting). 

Bathroom tub and shower is EPIC! As are all the supplied warm and soft blankets. Bed is beyond comfortable. Heat works really well. 

Ann is a wonderful host, very communicative and friendly. Thanks so much for opening up to home and being so mindful and organized to a traveler. Can’t wait to visit Denver again!"

Impeccably clean and after a long day of travel, the thoughtful touch of having granola bars and snacks on hand was a life-saver.

148553,20697678,229285199,2018-01-22,59028080,Myles,"This is a great location. I took the bus downtown for a convention. There are two choices. 
There is a good variety of stores and restaurants in the neighborhood. 
Ryan and Sean made me feel welcome from the first online connection. I have air quality related health issues. Some hosts don't respond to my initial questions. One was suddenly booked after I asked some questions. Ryan's response was quick, to the point and insightful. I did well in the apartment.
The large room and big desk were comfortable. The place was as clean as my home and most friends' homes. When I unpacked I felt at home.
The guide book was helpful. I used it to plan my free time. It has good maps.
When my return flight was cancelled due to weather at the destination and I needed two more nights, Ryan responded to my request quickly.
I only wish there had been time to get to know Sean and Ryan more. To this older man they seem like fine young men."

Le ménage avait été fait de manière impeccable, j'ai vécu une très bonne expérience. En revanche, en ce qui concerne le quartier il faut être assez méfiant, des individus peu recommandables peuvent s'y promener, je recommande de prendre un taxi ou similaire pour se rendre au centre ville ou rentrer la nuit."

Well supplied kitchen. Very clean and nicely put together apartment. Nice jacuzzi tub to boot. Kyle was very quick to respond to questions we had.

176892,23308643,435850709,2019-04-11,24620008,Tanner,The flat is amazing. It's sparkling clean and has a beautiful view of downtown at night.  Literally every need was anticipated and provided for - from extra toothpaste in the bathroom - to local recommendations (which were fantastic) .  The flat was in walking distance to most everything and will certainly be the first place we look to book when returning to Denver.
228878,32446997,466913341,2019-06-09,13326175,Tony,Location x Price is unmatchable. We were walking distance from some nice places to eat or grab coffee and it’s close to downtown. Btw the rooftop is super cool! Highly recommend

6315,756594,110649357,2016-10-27,94133843,Stephen,"Ling greeted us when we arrived and showed us the ropes. She was very friendly and made us feel welcome and very comfortable. The rooms consisted of a living room, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and laundry room access. There was a gas fireplace that made the whole basement feel warm and cozy. The bed was very comfortable, the sheets were soft, the pillows fluffy. My wife was very excited when she discovered how clean and fresh the towels smelled. We were able to take advantage of the hot tub twice - it was very relaxing (and yes, there were clean and fresh towels for that, too!). Ling and Chris have gone out of their way to make this one of the best places we've stayed."

As others have noted, the area isn't the greatest due to the high homeless population, but as long as you aren't going out at night by yourself, it isn't an issue.  Very nicely decorated, clean and AC works perfectly!"

The apartment is very functional, perfectly equipped and very well placed to move easily to Denver (5 minutes to Knox Street Station while walking). We had access to everything we needed.  I want to say that Eva's kindness is very important.  You can book with your eyes closed: two thumbs up!"

Walking distance to anything and everything we needed.  What a great value for this place!  I couldn’t recommend it enough and can’t wait to stay here again on my next stay in the area!  Thank you so much for everything mardy!"

The room was great, big, private and had a lot of amenities (refrigerator, Keurig, television) which was also great for privacy as we were in for the night. The bathroom was huge and they provided towels and toiletries.  The two dogs and cat were friendly and playful and gave a more at home feel as we have pets also. Close to the airport we would stay here again!"

The bedroom I believe is up against the kitchen because I could hear someone doing dishes. The walls are a little thin so, you can hear when people are home."

205732,27546197,324315398,2018-09-16,30172905,Kari,"House was pretty easy to find even in the dark. Check was super convenient with a door code. The remodel on the inside was modern and nice looking. Owner did not communicate well during stay as messages we unanswered. It says it’s smoking friendly outside but no ashtrays are provided. 10am check out is earlier than most air bnb’s I have stayed in, normally 11am or noon is standard. Had to pay an additional $20 for 11am checkout instead of 10am check out. Overall, I would stay here again if needed to, but still feel it was overpriced for what it was."

The home was absolutely lovely! My husband, brother, and I felt comfortable in the space. The fireplace was awesome. The bed was comfy. The jetted bathtub was and absolute treat. We were able to walk to a great Italian restaurant down the street. We also took advantage of Lyft; this was easy bc of how centrally located we were. I cannot say enough good things about Allison's home and hospitality! :)"

The Casita is charming, and it was nice to be able to leave the top half of the Dutch door open so we could get a nice breeze. The hens, bunnies, and kitties were an awesome addition!"

Bed linens and our bathroom were nice and clean which are the most important parts for us, but I wouldn't call the common areas or the carpets sparkling clean. Maybe our timing was just bad, I know these folks work a lot. It was a good value and location and I would stay again, given the chance."

The kitchen is stocked with everything dishes, pots, silverware, cutlery set  the whole works. The beds are softer than hotel beds there is bathroom in each room.. fireplace. I was out and about in the city but there were board games if the rain would have kept us in. Gloria thought of everything.. you will love it.  If I come back soon and this is available I will stay here again.."

215890,29386223,423002681,2019-03-12,102424628,Kayenat,"The carriage house adjacent to the garage was clean with thoughtful touches. The crisp white room with hints of color was soothing to the eye. It is only a few minutes' walk away from DU. Perfect if you are visiting for conference or kids.
Note that the bathroom area is separated from the bedroom area with curtain not a door."
124380,17530389,298786151,2018-07-29,174285352,Tracy,"The condo layout itself was great and so was the location! Loved the outside patio areas. The one bedroom A/C unit has to be vented out the patio door, which is a little inconvenient. Marcus was easy to communicate with and answered rift away when I did have a few issues. All in all, we had a great stay. "

45319,7359477,363376190,2018-12-28,93607319,Gabe,"We stay in Airbnb regularly.  This place was very dirty.  Cobwebs in the corners of the rooms, dusty shelf in the bathroom which was the only place to put bathroom items, rusted out behind the mirror and worst of all which made my wife very uncomfortable was the shower window was visible from the neighbor window above.  This to me was completely unacceptable that actions weren't taken to protect our privacy while bathing.

If you are going to rent your house as a business there should be a certain level of cleanliness and professionalism, this place obviously hadn't gotten the proper attention it needed.

Last, the cable was super fuzzy on the TV.  She came to try and fix it and was unable to and then sent me a 6 step on how to try to get it working, needless to say I'm on holiday to relax not to try and fix your cable issues."
16924,2360382,26332251,2015-02-09,26925524,Sharon,"Mary Grace's place was everything I was wanting in a place to stay and more. Her place is absolutely adorable, her attention to detail is nonpareil, and she provided everything you could possibly need, making her place far better than any hotel experience could provide. We felt very safe at her place and in the surrounding neighborhood. She has truly thought of everything anyone would ever need from a first aid kit (I don't even have this at my home) to an iron and COFFEE! There was no TV at her place, but this didn't affect my experience as I did not travel to Denver to watch TV, and it really encouraged us to get out and see as much of Denver as possible. There is also no dryer though this wasn't a problem either. In fact, it was kind of nice to be able to get away from some modern conveniences. 

To no fault of Mary Grace, her place had not been cleaned prior to my visit. However, she was extremely understanding and more than adequately compensated for this misunderstanding. So, if there is anything you need or there is ANY concern, do not hesitate to bring it to her attention. Mary Grace will not only make sure it is resolved as soon as possible, but she will go above and beyond to ensure that you are happy. 

In short, if you are looking for a unique, charming place to stay where the host clearly respects the environment and animals, and has put great effort into maintaining the pristine quality to this quaint home, then this is your place. I HIGHLY recommend staying at Mary Grace's."

11298,1454673,247513667,2018-03-28,170654190,Kelly,"The Victorian home is welcoming and clean.  The upstairs rental met all our expectations and then some ... fresh sheets, towels, and glasses, along with bath amenities like shampoo and conditioner.  the two bedrooms are private and open upon a living space--couch chair and TV.  Coffee and coffeemaker are provided as is a small refrigerator stocked with beverages for a charge.  The ground floor is communal, containing a kitchen, dining room and living room, and sound does carry up the open staircase.  I highly recommend this Denver neighborhood near the Botanical Gardens and shopping. Pamela is a lovely hostess."

There is a fireplace on the wall for ambience, a Bluetooth speaker to play music, a record player, extra pillows, fans, white noise makers for better sleep. The beds are wonderfully comfortable with down comforters. This space is darling, immaculately clean, and has all the little touches of home around every corner that you will love! The TV has Netflix and Hulu and there are books and board games available around the house. The backyard had little white lights along the fence. Look no further. Great price for a great place!"

Our group had a great time in Denver and Skylar’s place helped make it very memorable for us. 

The neighbors two doors down were very kind and spoke highly of our host! This helped us feel more comfortable in the space. 

The location was off Larimer enough we didn’t have to fight for parking but it was close enough it felt like an easy walk. The location was perfect for us!

Our bachelor party weekend was very memorable. We were able to walk almost everywhere we went and the Airbnb was the perfect scene to wind down after a white water rafting trip and recharge for a night out. 

Thank you again. The unit was awesome! We loved the open floor plan for making some group meals and the rooftop for enjoying the city skyline.

I highly recommend Skylar’ place!"

It is the coziest place ever, so clean, everything you need is there, including shampoo, coffee, etc! Jim is so easy to contact, always messages back quickly. You can easily take a 5 minute Uber or lyft to downtown for $7 or just buy a day pass for the RTD and there are stops right around the corner for buses, we had absolutely no problem getting around to Larimer Square, Denver Zoo, or 16th St Mall. This place definitely won't disappoint! "

It is light and airy with quality furniture and furnishings, and lots of nice touches - good quality towels, a really good hair dryer, lots of nice smelling soap and shampoo, and a great coffee machine. The bed is really comfortable, and there's even plenty of room to put down a yoga mat.
The separate entrance makes it private and the space isn't over looked in any way.
I loved the Koi pond, and the hot tub.
Becky and Tre and warm, friendly and informative.  This is my third time in Denver and this is my favourite place to stay so far."

The location was really handy - directly across the street from a Whole Foods and about 1 block from Union Station, making it handy for guests who arrive via the airport. I had no need for a car - being right near a mile-long pedestrian mall where there were shops, restaurants, food trucks, and coffee shops to explore.  Te unit was very clean, and well equipped with dishes, pots ad pans and everything I needed. I made full use of the fitness room that is in the building. The building itself is secure and the staff were helpful and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again if I return to Denver."

Great setting , very close to downtown, the communication was excellent. Some nice local breweries in walking distance. Denver was as always great too us again. ! Stay classy Denver."
185165,24181855,491052277,2019-07-19,153806623,David,The place was great and comfortable and accurately advertised! I'd stay there again!

93430,13993831,246627303,2018-03-25,173568238,Justin,"Staying with Candy was just flat put awesome. She was extremely well communicated and flexible on the front end of the booking process, but then was even 100x better than I could have expected for my stay, which was just over a month long. Candy was always very friendly and welcoming,  and tried to make my stay as accommodating as possible throughout my entire tenure with her. She really looks at her home as a B&B, rather than just a place for folks to crash. I would 100% recommend this unit to anyone I knew needing a place to rent in the Denver area!"

108253,15800346,129228409,2017-01-29,54133276,Sara,The apartment was small but clean and well stocked. It seemed overpriced considering I pay the same to stay in a house. And the bed was very uncomfortable. This kind of shocked us because it appeared so soft. 
200804,26530949,509553174,2019-08-14,59883824,Jason,"Borahm’s place is better than advertised especially if you value high quality views of the Rocky Mtns in particular at sunset! The penthouse condo was clean, easily walkable from downtown/baseball stadium and the checkin/out was seamless. My trip to Denver was for business; the condo was an attractive alternative to a stay in a cookie-cutter hotel room. I would absolutely stay in Borahm’s condo again and recommend it for both personal and business travel to Denver in particular the downtown area."
241399,37183949,521291461,2019-08-31,44198809,Olivia,"There are not enough great adjectives to describe Bobby and Julie’s place. The space was tastefully decorated, the bed was like sleeping on a cloud, Bobby and Julie were quick to reply and eager to get feedback on improving their place, the apartment was stocked with everything we would need, and it’s in a great part of town. Can’t wait to stay here again when I come back to Denver!"
52812,8410937,99917690,2016-09-06,89860941,Danielle,"The house was welcoming and roomy. There was opportunity to interact with the other guests, but it wasn't forced. Anything needed was either provided or for sale within 3 miles from the house."

188257,24575590,445127594,2019-04-28,94656066,Nicole,"Christy was very good at communication (quick response times). The space was cozy, decorated with nice touches, and a very soft bed! Near all the cool neighbors, we were a quick Lyft to everywhere worth seeing.      Being able to go in and out without disturbing the host (keyless entry pad) are a must when I Airbnb and Christy’s place was just that. Nice little kitchenette area too so you could refrigerate or warm up a snack."

178096,23402143,331128263,2018-10-01,18937355,Donnie,"The property is extremely clean, located in a nice neighborhood, convenient for our needs. It is about 25 minutes from downtown and 30 minutes to airport. 
Recommend guests take a look at hard map of area since (Hidden by Airbnb) map tends not to use the easiest and most direct routes. 
There was a bit of a problem checking in, since host was not available to explain cypher lock on front door. 
Would recommend and use again."
231782,33343614,475066762,2019-06-23,447550,Beth,Kenneth is a lovely host! Very helpful with local recommendations and quick responses.  His house is delightfully comfy and cozy; all the amenities of home.  I highly recommend staying here!!

The house looks exactly like the photos-- cheerful and cozy, and oh-so-comfy! (Also immaculate.) I was in Denver for continuing education at a professional convention and coming back to Julie's after a long day was like coming home. My only regret is that my intense schedule prevented me from getting to spend more time with Julie, herself. If I ever get a chance to come back to Denver, I will definitely stay with Julie and reserve more time for my lovely hostess!"
48770,7843605,167656138,2017-07-07,3392786,Kat,"Cynthia's place was very clean and comfortable for our one night stay. We didn't know they rented the house as well. We 
thought it was a private home. 
The apt is a basement apt, so the boys upstairs were pretty loud. Again you have to remember it's an old Victorian home with no sound proofing. 
The price was right and the location was great. We would stay their again. "

The room my boyfriend and I stayed in was very comfortable, and we appreciated having the amenities, like a refrigerator and coffee maker. 

Carly was also quick to reply and responsive when planning our arrival and departure."
52089,8356699,69075910,2016-04-09,51984312,Greg,We booked Meghan's Airbnb for a two night stay in Denver and had a great experience staying at her condo. The location was ideal and made it easy to maneuver around town. We felt extremely comfortable with the surrounding area along with the security of the building and the unit itself. The condo was nicely decorated and had a good sense of cleanliness. We would not hesitate to book this Airbnb again. Thanks Meghan! 
70422,11120331,291395980,2018-07-15,177898131,Sarah,"This house is great! We booked it for a group of 6 for one night and it was perfect. Very spacious, comfortable bedding, fans in every room to help with the heat. The air conditioning in the master suite was a life saver! The front porch is perfect - we all sat out there in the morning, drinking our coffee. Jessica was very responsive and extremely helpful. It’s a quick walk to a handful of fun places in RiNo and a super quick Uber/Lyft to downtown Denver. Quiet at night. Plenty of available outlets and a great kitchen set up!"
45005,7350249,52989637,2015-11-03,20659383,Christina,"Brooke's place was really great! It was very spacious and clean, perfect for a relaxing weekend away. She was close to great shopping and only a short cab ride to everywhere we wanted to go. The neighborhood was awesome! Brooke left us guides to the city and many thoughtful recommendations for places to go in the neighborhood. I cannot say enough great things about this Airbnb! "
152623,21024630,258815683,2018-04-29,12454513,Rika,Loved it! The amenities were amazing. The space was very clean and cozy. There’s also a patio-like outdoor area where you can enjoy the weather. Check-in/out was super easy. Plenty of street parking and great location (close to Colfax and easy access to Downtown). Jay and Robin responded very quickly to our questions too!

6800,776434,4234942,2013-04-21,5502900,Janette,"We rented Steve and Vicki's super-comfortable modern home for a week with the family.  The description fit perfectly.  The home is on a quiet street, in a convenient location with lots to walk to.  It was filled with natural light and a fully stocked kitchen that was great to cook in all week, and was incredibly calm and comfortable. The house is styled with interesting and thoughtful pieces through out, it was great to just stop and admire.  The home was a perfect gathering place for the whole family.  This was a far better option for us than one or multiple rooms at a hotel.  Steve and Vicky were incredibly helpful before and during the stay, considerate, and communication was super easy.  They set the stardard very high for our first airbnb experience.  

Steve, Vicky, and thier home were an absolute delight.  "
37876,6044888,185816603,2017-08-22,142850548,Chris,"First of all I want to say that I have never written a negative review in my life about anything.  Also, that her home is fine, the basement is very small and the bed is a bit rough but the home itself we found fully acceptable.   

Here's the problem with my experience:

I received a phone call on the day I was to arrive and Denise asked me what time I would arrive,  I told her we would be there about 6:15 P.M.   Denise aggressively and accusingly asked me, ""What do you mean WE""?  Even though I booked the room for 2 and clearly read all of the details to ensure this was allowed, Denise tried to make me pay extra every night before I even arrived.  I told her that I would take a look at my reservation and if I was mistaken about booking for two, I would pay the difference.  But I knew I wasn't.  Then about an hour later I got a text from her saying that it was fine and she was mistaken.  

Little weird so far, but mistakes definitely happen, I wouldn't have handled it as aggressively as she did but whatever, everyone is different, let's just get on with it.  

Then when we arrived, Denise immediately handed me an envelope that says in huge letters in black sharpie, I still have the envelope to this day, ""10% AIR BNB TAX.""  So even though I have already paid the required taxes, I know am being forced to pay without choice an extra 10% tax to Denise and it must be paid in cash.  

Obviously this is wrong and very unprofessional, but it is also blatantly illegal.  

I hope AirBNB will do something about this.  After I did not leave the envelope with the money in it as she demanded, I received several agressive, threatening text messages from Denise about it.  She was going to tell AIR BNB on me!    

I have the envelope itself and I have all the text messages still, if anyone at AIR BNB is interested in seeing them, please contact me."
153072,21028558,314480878,2018-08-26,179385571,Joe,This was a great place.  Michele met us in person to get us checked in and provided a nice tour of the house.  It was large enough for 10 of us without feeling cramped and was very clean.  The kitchen was setup well and WiFi worked great.  We would definitely stay here again.
116183,16589595,141743250,2017-04-04,115279055,Oscar,Very nice hosts and a wonderful house!
100573,14980203,336671274,2018-10-14,56665696,Kaelee,"Everything was kept very clean. I got exceptional sleep all through the late night hours and even late into the day since it was so quiet! The privacy was perfect, super fast wifi connection, I felt very comfortable whether keepingp myself or holding a few small conversations with her if we did cross paths getting ready for the day. Corny was a huge help to reccomending things nearby and what was easiest for me personally in my situation. I liked the coffee and tea! The neighbors were even nice!"

My biggest complaint would be no AC which is made somewhat clear in the description. In CO, households don't commonly have AC so it's not a huge deal since the nighttime's are very cool (we were staying during a relatively hot weekend). Overall she made the stay easy on us and cared about taking care of us. Bathroom was super clean. Highly recommend if the weather isn't too hot."

131340,18550517,156161000,2017-05-29,82380458,Venkat,"Tom's place is in a great location. It was less than 10 dollars for an uber to most places. He communicates very well and had responses for me within minutes of asking him questions. Unfortunately due to my flight times I did not get to meet tom but my friends said he was very friendly and helpful. He worked with my friends and I to check in and out at our leisure, something which we all greatly appreciated. He gave us fresh towels and even left a small care package with soap and toothpaste for us to use. The house itself is a little older which makes it look a little shabby and allows a few bugs/dust here and there. But it accommodated our large group of 10 very comfortably. Beds were very comfortable too! Only thing I could mention is that the place may be slighly overpriced, but its important to note that we booked this place pretty last minute. But all in all a great stay for me and my friends."
30350,4718459,249770840,2018-04-02,80805308,Adrianna,Christina was such a gracious host. I stayed here for a little over a month and loved it! Perfect location and perfect apartment!

Her home is in a lovely residential neighborhood that is within 5 minute walking distance to coffee shop, restaurants and church. 15 minute walk to zoo and botanical gardens. Had a lovely time riding their bicycles around downtown and on the river bike path and then drove up to the mountains to cross country ski-a novelty to do them in the same day. She had refrigerator space cleared for us. This was a great first airbnb experience. "

181031,23746299,340689779,2018-10-24,210531278,Diana,"This AirbnB is in a beautiful neighborhood that has lots of personality, close to convenient stores and great restaurants.  The bikes included with the stay made the trip!  We rode them everywhere and loved having the freedom to travel as we needed without having to invest the extra buck for every outing.  We were able to save on transportation and indulge elsewhere.  Loved the feel of the home..has everything you could need and want.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
237650,35260124,515937513,2019-08-23,57297847,Jenny,"The house was lovely and the neighborhood was exceptionally cute! Zoey had left us some nice snacks and everything in the place was easy to understand. Very well decorated. We would have liked some blackout shades or curtains in the bedrooms, but that is just a personal preference for sleeping. It was a wonderful stay!!"
105644,15509056,193471324,2017-09-13,12677224,Lyssa,"A short uber drive (of which there are plenty ubers nearby, even at 6:45 a.m.) to Convention Center area. Great walking neighborhood right near a park, grocery stores, eateries, and coffee shops.  It was a perfect spot for a solo traveler for business."

86599,13474217,112906557,2016-11-08,13248894,Jason,Kingas place was awesome. It's above her bar and restaurant and right off famous colfax Ave. Super dope location. Great for large groups traveling together.

The apartment is in an amazing location, close to a park for running/biking, restaurants and easy access to downtown via the free bus.

For business travelers it’s easy to access the convention center and beats most of the local hotels in my opinion.

207352,27777147,425153514,2019-03-17,243353926,Matthew,Atanasio + Ricki were incredible hosts. Their place was really nice and conveniently located in the Denver area! Their home offered plenty of space that suited all of our needs. I highly recommend this Airbnb!
6005,732845,230026932,2018-01-26,107282557,Scott,Great place with a ton of space. Amazing location to take advantage of a hip location and urban vibe!
34906,5508545,137310727,2017-03-14,102935272,Cristian Armando,"The location is average, but the listing lacks accurate categorization. It's listed as a whole room, but you're staying under the host's home in the basement. So any noise over 30 decibels (whispering) is going to disturb the host. She, quite rudely, barged in several time and told the FOUR of us to keep it down around midnight when we were playing music and talking. Besides that, breathing was allowed, so we were able to stay the night."

83234,13141932,182071161,2017-08-13,141345771,Ryan,Susan's home is spacious and beautiful. It was extremely clean and the outdoor areas were wonderful. There is a great public park a block away that we also enjoyed. She is very serious about the no shoes policy!

It's also in an amazing location....close enough to the highway if you are headed to the mountains and walking distance to some great restaurants downtown! Rachael was also really understanding when I ""left the keys"" in the condo, but it was a false alarm and they were in the car. :) I appreciate her hospitality and would stay again!"

159507,21516952,316701721,2018-08-31,2656725,Vicente,I had a great stay at Lisa’s. She is super sweet and very welcoming. Her house is very charming with a lot of character that she puts into it. The guest bedroom is private with an optional back entrance. I enjoyed the location as it’s in a very nice residential neighborhood but still pretty central to Denver and close to some nice restaurants and coffee shops. Would definitely stay again!

Jordan and Jason were extremely welcoming, friendly, and accommodating during our stay. They were helpful in making suggestions for places to visit and things to do in the area. The accommodations were clean and the home itself is very modern and unique! It is only a short walk to the RTD which takes you straight to union station in downtown. I would definitely recommend this air bnb to anyone staying in the Denver area!"

Very private. I felt like a local walking through the tree lined  neighborhood to the nearby grocery and restaurants. Its centrally located thus it was easy to uber or drive to sights in other neighborhoods. I’d defiantly stay there again if i come back to Denver!"

We connect through messages, and there's no problem going in and out. Her roomates are chill and the place is soooooo nice! Exactly as good as the picture. The place made us so hard to leave since the pets are too lovable:) we stayed for four nights and don't regret a thing. I would definitely stay at Cassi 's again for my next trip to Denver. Highly highly recommended!"

The house is setup to accommodate late arrivals with a key code on the back door. The check in process was simple and streamlined. Everything was super clean. Beds were comfortable. There was a nice laminated packet in the room with important information and tips on local favorites. Oh and the pets were very friendly and cute. Highly recommend this airbnb!

Jim is quick with recommendations and gives directions to local attractions which are clear and easy to follow. I highly recommend Hotbox Roasters, a coffee shop about 1/4 mile away."
190008,24805072,445108255,2019-04-28,39736708,Angelica,Very detailed and accurate with their description. The only thing to note is the lounging area is a common space. We enjoyed our stay and they were very helpful

239265,35971684,524281214,2019-09-05,3284552,David,"There's an unusually high number of amenities (toothbrush, razor, etc., like a hotel.)
There are multiple rooms, so I can't speak for every room, but the room I stayed in had a bed that was uncomfortably soft... a thick memory foam mattress. I am partial to firm mattresses and needed to sleep on the floor.  Also, while the property itself is extremely quiet, there is a loud fan outside the room.

It is extremely convenient to get into the house."

My best friend and I traveled from CT to CO for a concert and we loved how close we were to the venue! We had a blast and we will definitely be back again. We’re so thankful for such an amazing stay.

12755,1733052,250048168,2018-04-03,51454571,Monique,"Great setup in this basement. Comfy bed and nice bathroom.  TV didn’t work, but Jason was able to resolve quickly.  Only thing missing was a microwave.  The kitchen has one, but going upstairs is a little inconvenient and host ask that you not cook after 10pm.  Parking is down the alley and on second night the designated space was occupied."

There were times throughout the day when we could not get the heat to work but I'm sure that was something that could have easily been fixed. Other than that I really enjoyed my stay and would happily stay at this place again."
12127,1724186,140408927,2017-03-29,68838193,Raj,"Jessica and Carl were the best hosts. The house was as good as a 5 star hotel. Everything was clean and tidy . I was in Denver for a conference. In spite of informing them very late about my arrival, they made sure the room was ready. Carl even drove me to a nearby Indian restaurant to pick up dinner.  They made me feel like it was my home. I would recommend everyone travelling to Denver to stay with Jessica and Carl. I would surely stay with them again if I get a chance."
217548,29655836,504990657,2019-08-08,3328496,Alle,"Lägenheten är som på bilderna, till och med större och luftigare. Området är fullt med restauranger och barer men man sover gott då huset är mycket tyst. Det är gångavstånd (20 minuter) till downtown men i sommarhettan i Denver kan det vara värt att ta sig dit på ett annat sätt. Det ingår en parkeringsplats till bostaden vilket verkligen är toppen! Värt att notera är att det inte finns någon mataffär eller liknande i närheten. Det närmsta är två 7 Eleven vardera 15 minuters promenad bort. 

Tyvärr saknade vi en del känsla för detaljer i detta boende, till exempel städningen var inte på topp (Wayne skulle prata med de som utfört städningen, så förhoppningsvis är det bättre till nästa gäst). Vi har bott en hel del via Airbnb och det här är första gången då vi känt av att det är en plats enbart för uthyrning, trots att vi bott på rena ”Airbnb-hotell” tidigare. 

I övrigt var det en fin lägenhet och ett toppenhärligt område!"
176037,23238971,246094234,2018-03-24,109505264,Viren,"Sean is responsive and provided prompt responses to my questions. His instructions for parking and check-in were very helpful. The place was close enough for all the spots we were supposed to visit. It is clean and provided the basic amenities needed for a sleep after a long day out. It is private and there is a direct/private entry to the rooms. We did not get to meet Sean because we went to bed early after a long tiring day. However, Sean sent us a note morning."

During our stay, she was available whenever we had questions and made sure we were safe during an unprecedented hail storm.  She also provided us with a couple of snacks upon arrival and gave us great tips about the area.  All rooms have a different feel to them so that each one of us found a great room to stay in.  We can definitely recommend a stay. "

Spent some time with us when we first arrived and gave us a lot of history on the location and Denver. We were so busy the remainder of the trip, that we didn’t see each other again. :-( This Air BnB was incredibly spacious and clean. It had everything we needed and more!

Even so, there is plenty of refrigerator space for storing food, plus you can make coffee and heat up food in the microwave. Also, she provided wonderful recommendations for restaurants on nearby Tennyson St., which is an attraction in itself.

Marlene & her husband greeted us when we arrived and showed us everything we needed to know, and answered any questions we had. There were informative pamphlets and tour books about Denver. Once we got settled, we were given total privacy. 

Marlene is an accomplished artist and the walls are covered with her artwork. The decor is stylish and the furniture is comfortable. There was even a turntable and records to listen to! We also got a souvenir poster with some of Marlene's artwork, as do all her guests.

My only regret was not having more than 3 days to stay, but we will definitely return to Marlene's place when we go back to Denver!"

The bedroom is a small space, but the bed is very comfy. The living/kitchen area is great and comes furnished with all the things you could need. We could sometimes hear David walking around/working on things around the house upstairs but he even respects the quiet hours he sets for guests so it was never a nuisance or disturbance. The location is wonderful and I highly recommend Machete tacos and tequila just a block away! Overall, the apartment and David were instrumental in my trip to Denver being amazing!

The location is wonderful. We relied almost exclusively on the bike share to get around, with a little bit of uber when we were tired. You are accessible to many different areas of Denver. 

We hope we get to stay at Mary's again! "

240100,36521451,507451278,2019-08-11,130792971,Daniel,Amberly was nothing short of an amazing host. She was extremely accommodating and thoughtful in all her touches. The space is very cozy and has everything you might need for a short stay. I would definitely stay here again as the location is central and so convinient.

We walked everywhere including downtown and It never felt far. The neighborhood is full of great coffee shops, restaurants, and dispensaries. We loved staying there and if/when we come back to Denver we would love staying there again. The room was perfect for my boyfriend and I's stay. Channan was an amazing host offering us coffee and banana bread, which was too sweet. You will not be disappointed staying here as it has everything you could possibly need."

Place was spotless and loved the fact that there is an in-unit laundry facility. Everything you'll ever need is there. Apt is on the 20th floor with a nice view of Denver. Right in the center of downtown. Free garaged parking space, too. Perfect stay. Can't think of one thing to complain.  "

47956,7763814,456516698,2019-05-21,37921709,Michelle,"Michael’s place was perfect for our long weekend stay. We had no issues finding parking nearby and the bagel shop down the street (Rosenberg’s) was a great option for a quick, delicious breakfast with NY style bagels. We enjoyed the peace and quiet of the neighborhood while being a quick walk to RiNo or cab/scooter downtown. It was plenty of space for just the two of us. The entertainment room with the projector and backyard space were welcome perks! We found the place to be sparkling clean when we arrived with all the amenities needed. Would definitely stay again!"
115233,16404214,541683781,2019-10-05,287976387,Levi,This place is great to stay at. A lovely old house that worked great for our group. They were great hosts and were quick to get back to me if I had a question during our stay. I would stay here again.
17808,2653512,54577399,2015-11-22,30705571,Penny,"My husband and I had a great stay. The guesthouse is beautiful and exactly as the pictures show. No detail was left undone, down to - conveniently- the exact shampoo & conditioner I use. It looks like it was taken right out of an HGTV makeover show. It is spotless and homey. Feels more like staying at a friend's place. The LoHi area is great too. We were close enough to downtown, but LoHi itself has great restaurants (Gallop Cafe for brunch & Duo restaurant for dinner were great) you can walk to and a nice, residential feel with a ton of character. We took a few Lyfts into downtown and around the general vicinity of the area and they were each only $6.95! Super convenient and affordable to get around. This was our first AirBnB experience and the bar has definitely been set high."
153553,21042587,327427217,2018-09-23,178151421,Arturo,"Matt helped us from the moment we booked our stay months in advance. He reached out several times, made sure we were good with our check in, and his place was pristine. We had so much fun since so many breweries were close and anything else was basically 10 minutes away. 

I can’t wait to visit Denver again."

100611,14992777,105710699,2016-10-02,69514467,Miguel,"This is the best Airbnb experience I've had yet from start to finish. For starters, the private bedroom was very comfortable and even though the basement wasn't quite finished yet (just needed to be furnished), everything was still kept neat and clean. Plus since it was in the basement, we basically had our own private bathroom, which is a big plus. We didn't spend too much time at the house because we wanted to explore Denver as much as possible, but it's in a great location so that everything we wanted to see was just a short Uber ride away. 

Aside from that, Banks is an awesome host. Before, during, and after arriving he was always very responsive and went above and beyond to accommodate our needs (even after we were technically checked out - thanks again for that!). His instructions for check in are thorough and he had a nice list of suggestions for things to do in Denver. If I ever visit again, I will definitely be looking at this place first, you won't be disappointed! "

232811,33586588,502382879,2019-08-04,34413792,Alice,"As described, a nice place with nice amenities and they have on-call people if you need to contact them (everything about check-in and check-out was described prior to arrival and so we didn't need to :)). There were even some pleasant check-in surprises, like a couple of local beers and popcorn! It is a bit noisy being on the street but Sonder provides both a white noise machine and ear plugs! If you are a super sensitive sleeper though, this might not be the best place for you, but we didn't have a problem with it. Definitely a great and easy place to stay!"

It was definitely a home away from home, Ryan and Maia went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed and checked in I see we might need anything else.

221139,30563692,400335967,2019-01-11,163087118,Alexandra,"This place is SO CUTE! The owners have clearly put a lot of thought into making our stay special. We greatly appreciated the coffee, sugar,  oatmeal, and chocolates in the cute little containers they were in. The towels were the softest towels I’ve ever felt and I’m going to buy some for my own home (I loved them that much). I was a little concerned that the garage door would let in a lot of cold air but it surprisingly didn’t. The unit stayed cozy and we loved laying on the couch watching the snow fall through the garage door windows. The owners were quick with responses and gave us privacy. The unit was super clean and, being a former housekeeper myself, I have no hesitation saying that the dishes, sheets, and towels were sparkling clean. When I come back to Denver, I will definitely be staying here again."

I am not too fond of the place's immediate neighborhood, but Anne's house was very close to everywhere I wanted to go. Uber to downtown costs about $5-$8 dollars depending on the time of the day. It was pretty close from the airport (I took the A train and two buses on my way to Anne's house which cost $9, and took Uber from Anne's house to DEN airport which cost $27). The house is very cute from the inside. The bedroom is exactly like in the picture. I was out pretty much all of the time during my stay and wasn't able to really interact with Anne, but she seemed very nice. "

Just fill in the TK's with the information that you have. Also, add the attachments....if you want. ** Carol, This isn't a letter I wanted to write, but I feel compelled to paint a better picture for you as to what happened during our stay at the Denver Airbnb on the weekend of Dec. 14-16, and to perhaps provide you a little clarity as to why I am bitterly disappointed in how the situation was handled. What happened to us was not only negligent, reckless and rude, it was inexcusable from a business standpoint, which I can only hope means something to you.  Before I describe the sequence of events, let me just say that I spend roughly 70 nights a year at hotels, often at the Maven downtown Denver. I have never had a single problem during these stays. So when we planned a rare get together with a few family and friends — a couple of us coming in from out of state for the occasion — I considered booking us rooms at the Maven. I ultimately decided on an Airbnb because I wanted the experience to be as special as possible. This is how I came to select yours.  We arrived to the unit at TKTK on Friday, Dec. 14 in the late afternoon, and — after some confusion, given the identical nature of the units — punched in the code we were provided to enter the premises. The gate opened for us. We then found the unit we believed to be ours, unit TKTK, and punched in the code to open the garage. Once again, it opened without complication. For all intents and purposes, there was absolutely no reason to believe we had the wrong unit. Why would we? Everything we punched in worked. So we parked our cars in the garage, and unloaded our stuff. The unit was unoccupied. The refrigerator was empty. We unpacked our stuff, including our food and drinks, and enjoyed the rooftop view for a few minutes before going to dinner. We were at dinner for about two-and-a-half hours, our cars still in the garage where we parked them, easy to spot for anybody checking in on us. Or so we thought. Upon returning back to the unit, we discovered that our bags had been placed in front of the garage, unattended, with people from  different unit gathered nearby, with a single note attached. The note, which is attached here, was curt and accusatory, as if we were perhaps vagrants who happened through. The tone suggested that we entered the wrong unit on purpose, a presumption that was at the same time baffling and ignorant, given the available evidence. In it, the word ""police"" was included, and ""trespassing,"" rather than a more reasonable, ""please call immediately as there seems to be a mistake."" Please understand, on principal, how this looked from our perspective. We had no idea that we were in the wrong unit because all the codes worked to get in, and yet we come back to discover our belongings have been displaced.  Not only that, but rooted and rifled through. Some of the items that were originally in one bag ended up in others. The $100 bottle of unopened TKTK whiskey, was gone. Nowhere to be found. Also missing was the food that we had picked up for our friend who is on a special dietary plan, given his heart condition. We later learned that the food was thrown away, while there was no explanation as to what happened with the whiskey. We discovered that a blanket had gone missing as well, with a shrug of the shoulders as to where when we later inquired. All of this rifling, rooting, and wanton discarding of personal property happened within the time of our dinner out, which seemed a particularly hasty and presumptuous response to a misunderstanding. Once we discovered our belongings scattered outside (though luckily still there—including personal electronic and so on), we made a call to TKTK. She came over to the place, and admitted right off the bat — in the same rude manner that the note was written — that it was she who had penned it. With zero empathy for the idea that it was an honest mistake, she carried on with an short tone, as if we were deviants trying to get by with something. She continued this attitude until she opened the garage and discovered our cars parked there. At this point her tone changed from accusatory to something more like confusion. If there was any care that she might have spoiled a reunion between friends and family, it was never in evidence. Though she also admitted to going through our belongings and of spearheading the idea of dumping everything outside, when the missing items were brought up she had no answers — though she did confess to throwing away the food.  Now, I ask you — is that the way any of this should have went down? Within minutes of assessing the situation it was obvious to us there were better ways to handle it. We can admit that we made a mistake, but how could we have known that we did when all the codes were were given worked for the mistaken unit? And what do these intersecting/matching codes mean for your security there? We should never have been able to enter the incorrect unit! If anything, the outrage should belong to us — and anybody else — who could have so easily been broken into using a common code into any unit. And why did your agent there assume that we were up to no good, rather than putting two and two together that there was a booking in one (empty) unit and a unit that should have been empty and wasn't? Why the assumption of wrongdoing rather than a simple mistake? Why the accusations?..."

204249,27271600,553611200,2019-10-24,36724303,Krisann,"We enjoyed the Airbnb. This place was in a good location close to a lot, very clean, and had everything you'd need for a fun stay. The only thing I didnt realize was that the left upstairs is only enough for the bed. You can't stand up there. It worked for us because we are both about 5'6 but if you're tall, it would be a struggle to even fit on the bed. We had a blast though and it's very centrally located. We drove everywhere but I'd assume taking uber's would pose a problem because of the location being on a side alley. Have fun!"
156566,21190064,541121909,2019-10-04,85953700,Ashley,Perfect location if traveling into downtown Denver or wanting to check out Aurora. Rachel and her house mate we great hosts and we loved being able to chat with the other guest staying there as well. Very neat and cute stay! :)

The home is large, with three full floors of space for people to sprawl. The home is well-maintained and very clean. All of the beds were comfortable and the home was well appointed with items that are needed for a short stay. I would  highly recommend it to anyone considering a larger space in a great neighborhood in downtown Denver. Communication with the owners was seamless."

Everything was so clean and comfortable, with such nice touches from the coffee and tea to the yogurt and cookies. 
It’s so close to all the sports venues if that’s your destination, but you you’re surrounded by a neighborhood of lovely, quaint homes. 
Susan is such a gracious hostess. 

We would definitely stay here again!"

160237,21593370,311613069,2018-08-21,14864925,Arlene,"The host does not live in apartment.  She works for property management company that list the apartment on Airbnb.  I had no contact with host.

She didn't respond to my emails before check in.  I wanted to know where to park when I arrived to check in.  I arrived on Saturday night at 7 pm.   There was no street parking.   

The neighborhood is the highest density in Denver.  Street parking is difficult.

The apartment is minimally decorated and lacks friendly decor.  I felt the apartment had a corporate feel.  The bedroom has no dresser or luggage rack.

I stayed in apartment for three days.   The apartment had only one travel size bottle of shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel.

The assigned parking space for apartment is on lower level of garage which has no elevator.   The garage level has no signage on door that has staircase to enter building. 
The garage has low ceilings, poor lighting, and is creepy.

The art museum and botanical garden is 20 minute walk from apartment.  Trader Joes is one block away.

The king size bed was extremely comfortable.

Toilet seat was loose and bathroom fan was noisy.

Only coffee is provided.

I would not stay at apartment again.  "

Sara and Gabe did such a good job with their place and the experience you have while staying there. The decor is so fun, the place is really clean, loved hanging out on the patio, and it was an all around great experience being there. My husband and I want to come stay here again when we come back to catch another concert at the Red Rocks! Thanks so much you two!!"

5160,665622,60402678,2016-01-23,46587454,Michael,"Becky did an amazing job making us feel welcomed in her home. The house was exactly like the listing offered, and had some great amenities inside. 

The house was also just one short block away from a few great restaurants and places to grab a drink later in the evening. 

Check in & Leaving the house was easy as pie, and just required throwing the towels in the wash. 

I would highly recommend staying here when you are in the area. "

Otherwise it was an absolutely phenomenal space! The back yard is a beautiful chill out spot!"

6651,760023,518510208,2019-08-26,102762544,Jason,Jill and her husband are great hosts and have a very cool house from the early 1900s.  It's in a great location with easy access to downtown as well as City Park.  It is a room inside their main house and there were no issues at all.  The room and bathroom next to it are great for a couple and quite isolated from the rest of the hosue.   Be sure to spend some time with the hosts exchanging your traveling stories.

203121,27064399,343174054,2018-10-30,210359925,Amanda,The home was beautiful and stylish. The home was also very spacious. Jon and Talene were great hosts. However we wish someone would have mentioned that there were no window coverings (blinds or curtains) in any of the windows other than the bedrooms.

I loved this place because it felt very warm and felt like it was a place to relax and enjoy. A lot of Airbnb places are super bare with cheap IKEA furniture and crap on the walls, not this place. The bed was super comfy too."

I recommend staying here when you visit Denver"
131719,18582812,536945709,2019-09-27,157394400,Patti,"Great location but we left after one night. The cool brick wall bedroom does not reflect the rest of the unit and that bedroom is the first room you awkwardly enter through the front door.  Second bedroom has no appeal.  Many items in unit in disrepair.  True it is an old building which is cool, but we were just not comfortable with the general condition."

Our team had an excellent time, and the 6 of us had plenty of space to spread out. The place is very well appointed and set up, and we appreciated JD’s attention to detail and responsiveness. Four of us had long hair, and he kindly dropped off two hairdryers. Our team appreciated the clear communication and helpful notes around the house, which made this a very enjoyable experience. The neighborhood is nice, pretty quiet yet close enough to stores, restaurants and downtown to make JD’s a terrific base for spending time in Denver."

The space is separate from the main house with it's own key-code access, so there's plenty of privacy. It's a beautiful and open space and everything seems very new. I particularly loved the deep bathtub! The bed was also very comfy and there was coffee for the morning. It's close to I25, so it was perfect for my commute. It's also really close to a coffee shop and bars and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again!"

Also very close to the Botanic Gardens and Cheeseman Park.  The house was very comfortable, stylish, and clean.  The backyard was gorgeous and the front porch was very cute.  We loved hanging out in both.  The house was also stocked with games and a hot tub and we were so comfortable there we hardly wanted to leave!  The host, Jeremy, is super responsive.  I wholeheartedly recommend this home!"

139509,19548421,318394024,2018-09-03,51086,Clint,"Stefani’s place was a great place for my family of four. The size of the apartment was plenty for us. Also the proximity to Red Rocks (20min drive) and downtown Denver (15min drive) made getting around really convenient. The on-street parking can be full if you get in later in the evening but we never had to park too far away. 

There are nice little touches throughout this apartment starting with super fast WiFi and an Apple TV which I love as a tech guy. Also she provided earplugs for attending a Red Rocks concert as well as a washer and dryer in the unit. There is also a shoe rack at the entrance which was really handy. 

There is no AC as far as we could tell so it was a little stuffy after a hot day but after opening both windows and turning on the fan we were needing blankets by morning after that Colorado cold air kicks in :)

The one thing to note is that it is a studio apartment with a sofa pullout and not a one bedroom so don’t expect a separate bedroom. Other than that it was a great place to stay. Highly recommended!"
196346,25918224,433538475,2019-04-06,20866172,Erin,"We had a great long term stay at Natasha’s place this winter! The Airbnb is located conveniently close to lots of fun breweries and restaurants in the RiNo area. It’s also close to I-70 so you can head straight up to the mountains easily. We also enjoyed going to movement rock climbing gym on RiNo, just 3 min away :) The inside of the Airbnb was just as good. You can tell it’s very new and everything is clean. It feels really cozy with cute wood paneling on the walls and the faux fireplace heater. There was plenty of kitchen storage and storage in closets in both bedrooms, we had everything we needed for a 3 months stay easily put away. Natasha was always quick to respond if we needed anything, and very helpful. I definitely recommend this airbnb, would stay again!"

Loved your sense of style and the kitchen was an added bonus.  The entries to the apartment were smart and easy to use-it was nice to have a dedicated parking spot, too.  We highly recommend your place to a single person or couple looking for more character and privacy than a hotel room can offer."

46394,7577128,92436994,2016-08-08,61861604,Bill,"Jeff and JP’s house was perfect for us!  It’s neat and tidy, convenient to everything, and has a great floor plan for two couples traveling together – separate bathrooms for each bedroom, bedrooms on first and second floor, washer/dryer for convenience – all the amenities you might want at MUCH less than the cost of a hotel room!  We were fortunate to catch Jeff on his way to the grocery store before we arrived, and it was a convenient time to ask him to pick up a few snacks, drinks, etc. for us.  It was a real treat to have some refreshments waiting when we arrived, and went above and beyond what should be expected of any host!  The previous reviews are on target re: a wealth of information about places to visit, eat, drink, etc., and the house is even larger than the photos make it look.  Thanks Jeff & JP, for sharing your little piece of Denver with us, we enjoyed every minute!"
7055,787456,103642383,2016-09-23,96103996,Mark,The host was very welcoming and accommodating!  It is an excellent location as it is only 1 block from the Denver Botanical Gardens.   The host communicated everything we needed to know very clearly and responded to any questions promptly!  I would definitely stay here again on a return trip to Denver.   
104052,15314730,485407595,2019-07-10,65537777,Jonathan,Highly recommend. Two colleagues and I had a great time staying here while attending a 3-day convention at the Gaylord Convention Center.
188886,24684368,354376020,2018-12-01,180292082,Jonathan,"This is a gem of a place near DU. The on-site host Julia was wonderfully responsive. The thoughtfulness that went into preparing this home for guests made the stay very easy. 

I would highly recommend this AirBnB and hope to stay here again when I return."
73212,11521979,102374681,2016-09-18,57470881,Mark,"Great place!  It was a really cool setup and location was perfect! 

Some opportunities that would make it even better: 

-Access to the thermostat
- A fan
- blind coverage on the window that won't shine light in your eyes in the morning.  


Overall it was great.  Walking distance to everything! "
94801,14187514,296407272,2018-07-25,45550822,Michelle,"The home is cute and perfect.
We were greeted upon arrival, given a tour and made to feel at home.
Beds are comfortable. Home is cozy.
Patio was great to sit on with coffee and a book. Robert and Vance provided bottled water, milk, orange juice, fruit, and the coffee pot ready for coffee.
There are many food places in the area, quick 2-7 minute drive.
You are 1/2 mile from Sloan's Lake. Perfect for walking, running, biking, and seeing the downtown skyline or the mountains.
Quick drive to downtown or cheap Uber ride. 
We loved our stay in their home. I will look to book this place again on my next trip to Denver!
Thank you for an such a cozy, perfect home!!"
239986,36419998,522924913,2019-09-02,6385560,Rob,"Had a great stay at Paul's place while in Denver.  The location was fantastic, and it had everything needed.  Paul's recommendations around the area were very helpful!"
41691,6846954,92854112,2016-08-10,19235154,Meg,"Elizabeth was welcoming and easy to communicate with before and during the rental. The apartment is private, spacious, comfortable, charming, modern and flooded with natural light.  Would absolutely recommend renting here! "
7536,833937,145298774,2017-04-17,51166120,Bethany,"I can't say enough good things about this place.  Feels like home the second you walk in, has every amenity you could possibly need, and the bed was incredibly comfortable.  Central to all the Denver attractions and easy access to the highways to get to nearby cities and hiking trails.  Take advantage of all Denver and Colorado has to offer!  We had the trip of a lifetime."
126001,17736834,213520115,2017-11-21,57319343,A. Rae,My grouped LOVED our stay! Peter’s home is beautiful & the neighborhood was very quaint. In a great location to local shops & food. We didn’t want to leave. Will definitely stay here again if i return to Denver.
61623,9433028,468538389,2019-06-12,68417260,Celine,"A cute little apartment close to fun Denver hotspots--not so close to the action that things get loud or unsafe, not so far you can't have fun! Don't be spooked by the hallway downstairs. It seems like you're going into a basement, but it's a cute apartment past the door."
96146,14406405,402481839,2019-01-18,180641992,Kiana,"The photos and reviews don't do this home justice! Just a really wonderfully comfortable, peaceful, well-appointed, cozy home away from home in a PERFECT location!"
118157,16846436,177752258,2017-08-03,77825498,Brent,"Beth and David have crafted the perfect apartment for a weekend away in Denver.  Removed from the central action in a charming Highlands neighborhood, the location offer quiet reprieve, while being close enough to great restaurants and shopping when you're ready to engage.  They were outstanding hosts, delivering outstanding information about the surrounding area highlights.  Would highly recommend this space to solo travelers and couples."
208207,27960015,513514198,2019-08-19,136386208,Aphrah,Great place to stay! Perfect for a big group. So much fun. Great backyard & tons of room.
131407,18568473,234102031,2018-02-11,1647204,Lisa,Sam was very easy to communicate with. Checked in and out without a problem.
166779,22123062,550390489,2019-10-18,302829095,Kaitlin,"Great place! Amenities were as advertised, really good location to be close to town but still have a private and quiet spot to come home to. Owners were very communicative and responded quickly. We enjoyed our stay!"
179057,23577497,368968119,2019-01-08,98954846,Ethan,Awesome space that is very close to downtown and in a very fun part of town! Very relaxing space that was very comfortable for our time spent here.
72357,11336016,348917836,2018-11-15,220818691,Michael,"Sally’s place was great.  Unfortunately my schedule never allowed me to meet her personally, but the bedroom was clean, bright, and had all of the amenities I would want in a place (she even keeps a coffee maker and grinds in the room!).  Overall, one of my best experiences with Airbnb and I would suggest it to anyone making their way through Denver!"
11030,1327856,459776954,2019-05-27,20077988,Katherine,Leila and Alex's place has great common spaces  - especially the roof deck! Definitely leave some time in your itinerary to enjoy it!
235670,34366188,528227543,2019-09-12,57652389,Alex,"I had such a fun time staying at DJ Bella's place during my short trip. It's an amazing value for being located so close to downtown. The old house is very charming and the room is furnished comfortably. Bella gives you pretty much everything you need, just don't forget a towel! If you are lucky enough to meet Bella, she's a delight."
239227,35971684,484832281,2019-07-09,23790691,Katie,Great place for those needing to get to the airport! It was easy getting in and out and the rooms and bathroom were very clean and had plenty of amenities available.
238884,35796686,481412161,2019-07-04,14990218,Blake,"Great place, clean with a renovated bathroom.  Hosts provided great communication and were proactive in preempting WiFi being down (including providing alternative solution!).  Check-in and out was a breeze.  Just a heads up this unit is below the main house so you can hear stuff going on upstairs when others are home / active."
79948,12901712,168587488,2017-07-09,131609804,Kelsey,"Looking for a conveniently located town house with great coffee and awesome hosts? This is definitely the place for you! Mimi and John provide guests with a top-notch Denver experience. Their home is comfortable, especially the gel bed, and the balcony has a great view of the mountains behind the beautiful city of Denver. 

Matthew and I were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go downtown, and Lyft rides were never over $7 to get from downtown to where we were staying. John will make you delicious lattes and cappuccinos in the morning along with fresh pastries and fruit. You won't be able to find many Air B&B's that will provide breakfast, so this was a special treat! 

John and Mimi are both wonderful hosts who made sure we were well taken care of. They provided us with a laid back atmosphere during our trip, and their company was greatly appreciated. Bitsy was definitely an added bonus, and it was always a joy to see her waiting for us at the bottom of the stairs in the mornings. We hope you enjoy your time in Denver as much as us! "
68677,10500808,195285993,2017-09-18,95841741,Remy,Emily accommodated me on late notice and even let me extend my stay a few hours when I needed it. Much appreciated!
28644,4294257,325099564,2018-09-18,195644304,Tara Marie,Travis was a great host. So friendly and welcoming. The Airbnb was stocked with everything we needed ( I have been to many where you have to supply your own paper products ) . The location was AWESOME!! We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to have a meal or drink. We will def be back.
61586,9433028,285421959,2018-07-03,98981609,Harjasleen,Steven and Naren are great hosts. They responded quickly and were lots of help. The space is fairly clean. The kitchen had everything you'd need. The yard is cool and we spent some time out there because our baby sleeps early.  A few things to note - I'm not sure this space would be great for 3 or more adults. The bathroom is in the master bedroom which may be a bit weird for access unless you're very comfortable with your roommates. Great for a family though for a short stay.  We did encounter some spiders in the bathroom but not a big deal it is a basement suite and the owners are taking care of it. Overall we had a good stay and enjoyed getting to see Denver.
67865,10363495,150346066,2017-05-07,56385010,Genevieve,Anne was a great host. She was accommodating and helpful. Check-in was a breeze. The space is modern and comfortable. The location was excellent. Situated in a really cool residential area. Bars and restaurants and shops within walking distance. Lyft rides were under $10 to just about everywhere we went. I would stay here again in the future! Fyi- the tv doesn't have a lot of channels- I would recommend bringing an hdmi cable to hook up a laptop. We did that and it worked perfectly. 
162290,21752804,422172743,2019-03-10,71956845,Catherine,A great place to relax and spend time with friends! We loved the stylish place and enjoyed using the hot tub!
20366,3412478,215976115,2017-12-02,16740499,Janelle,Really love this place. Easy to get to and has some lovely touches. Kind host that was able to accommodate us in such short notice. The neighborhood is great to walk to some great restaraunts as well as a dispensary right down the street.
89127,13657498,91375895,2016-08-05,6864978,Jason,"Jeff & Sweet's were great! The listing was accurately listed and Jeff stayed up for my late arrival. Jeff clearly enjoys interacting with his guests and takes great pride in his home and his cooking. He prepared a great breakfast. If you're looking for a family vibe and sense of Denver community, stay here! "
34339,5402378,491136044,2019-07-19,9930915,Jacob,Very cozy space within a short drive to some local attractions like the botanical garden. It is important to note it is a pet friendly location and we did find there to be animal hair on the couches and bedding. The hosts were responsive in addressing this issue but we were only there for a short stay so it already impacted 1 of our 2 nights. I probably wouldn’t stay here again.
126011,17736834,352776586,2018-11-25,207846053,Peggi,The is a beautiful house with a great kitchen and nice open floor plan. There is plenty of room for large groups and the host keeps the kitchen well stocked which is convenient for making meals. The bedrooms were clean but the platform beds were not as comfortable as a traditional 2-mattress bed. The location is good if you are coming from the airport.  The host goes out of his way to accommodate requests!
227123,32047791,439320208,2019-04-18,135679101,Chris,"This is a great, comfortable and charming little pad with convenient access to anything you could need while staying in Denver.  There’s plenty within walking distance and the city’s best attractions are all nearby.  I would definitely stay again!"
229528,32631589,507511780,2019-08-11,272508934,Alex,Very nice and clean! Great recommendations on places around town.
235547,34361721,475687662,2019-06-24,218476076,Olivia,Super clean and homey. Zaid was very quick to respond and everything was quick and easy. Close to the airport and nice for an early flight!
170042,22513575,284531098,2018-07-01,1747723,Karen,"Lisa's place was great! Such a wonderful historic house with fun quirky touches. You have to love having a knight in shining armor in one of your bedrooms! The kitchen is upstairs while the dining room is downstairs, but we found that the opportunity to travel the grand staircase only enhanced our love of the place.  (And there is a small eating area in the kitchen as well, so you don't HAVE to transport your meal downstairs unless there are several of you or you want a more formal setting.) Lisa was wonderful to work with and a great communicator. Oh, and be sure to go to Little Man Ice Cream - you won't regret it!"
19713,3404692,438872280,2019-04-17,255633755,Jennifer,Very nice place. Roomy and good location. Comfortable beds   Nice amenities

58329,9010867,70456302,2016-04-17,27974585,Roy,"Nice area right by downtown Denver. Great location and nice bar and lounge right in front. Parking is bit of a hassle due to either having to park in the street or the narrow alley with a larger vehicle, although we thought there was an actual parking space with the listing, it was worked out im the end. . Tanya answered all questions we had and even when our flight was delayed she allowed us to check out later. All in all, the stay was more than accommodating and would definitely be back.  "
239305,35971684,560400767,2019-11-06,1464391,Peter,Perfect spot for overnight connections in Denver.

104137,15337887,120983489,2016-12-12,7660924,Megan,The host canceled this reservation 66 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

43852,7131495,166155913,2017-07-02,33375175,Gabrielle,"Very thoughtful and welcoming host, room and location were exactly as described.

35623,5630819,222034948,2017-12-28,95873904,Jordynn,"The location is good, just south of Denver in a quitter neighborhood that was close to my family in highlands ranch. The beds were very comfortable and it was a cute house. It is older and we stayed during a cold snap. We had a little trouble with the heat one night, might have been user error as there is a fancy nest thermostat. Gretta did have space heaters which got us through night and after playing with the nest it seemed to stay pretty warm for the rest of our stay. The kitchen is updated and Greta left us some wine and treats, which we really appreciated. Gretta was very prompt in making contact and we had no issues with check in. I liked this place because it allowed dogs, even though my sister didn't end up bringing her puppy for this trip."
92078,13845981,403424550,2019-01-20,98055690,Julie,"I absolutely loved staying at Becki’s place. Super comfortable room with tv, mini fridge and private bathroom. Great location and close to where I needed to go. Being greeted by one of their dogs was super cute, they’re huge but well behaved. I think this is the best Airbnb room I’ve booked."
20858,3425074,430508530,2019-03-30,34052912,Brenda,"Cozy, convenient and more private than other shared spaces I've stayed at.  Super convenient location... walk to everything and cheap Uber to the convention center"

79787,12889829,417585647,2019-02-27,166904605,Ben,"Dave's house is comfortable and cozy. What sets it apart though is that it is in an amazing area with easy access to downtown, the freeways and public transportation."
10443,1189999,74266753,2016-05-14,57571367,Rebecca,"A wonderful week staying at Mike's listing with all the comforts of home. My family enjoyed his sleeping accommodation with plenty of room to spread out on the sectional couch. His location is perfect with free roadside parking in a quiet neighborhood and short walk to shops or restaurants. Shy, his dog, has such a sweet and gentle personality. I recommend to anyone looking to a place to stay in Denver."

Loved that there were several places within walking distance, including the very lively farmer's market on Sunday. Mark was also very accommodating with giving us a later check out time. Thanks for everything!"
213883,29127570,426675811,2019-03-21,136785347,Michelle,Thanks Suzanna.. it was perfect for what we needed. My son just wish there was a television. But other than that it was clean and cozy and we really enjoyed the Jacuzzi tub. 
183689,24057621,505077793,2019-08-08,643264,Elliot,"Great location and house. Perfect for a family of four. All the amenities we could need and a super simple checkin/checkout. 

Only slight issue (and this is minor) is the stairs going up to the second floor are a little tight so be careful, but they are not dangerous (they are well lit and marked)."
237232,35059929,468949334,2019-06-13,121737108,Alexandria,"Aprel’s place was great. She provided a lot to use including a personal kitchen for the two rooms in the downstairs. It was stocked with pots, plates, etc.  You check yourself in through the back which made it convenient due to time constraints. The room is very cozy and welcoming. Highly suggest"
32776,5010213,331461814,2018-10-02,2885218,Ainsley,"Had a wonderful stay in Andrea's beautiful condo! A bit of confusion checking in, but Andrea  quickly responded and graciously walked us through the steps. The space is beautiful, in a great location (especially if you love to walk like we do!), near Union Station for easy access to the train and Coors Field for a Rockies game. One tip for anyone sleeping on the pull-out couch: the building across the street keeps its lights on all night, but the pull-down shades help tremendously, and the Doma sound machines help drown out train noise. Would definitely stay again, thanks Andrea!"
17542,2467260,242357451,2018-03-11,1994829,Kyle,"Awesome place! I was a visiting filmmaker who came to Denver to present a film at the Sie Film Center and Ryan's place was perfectly situated. A 10 minute walk from a lot of cool dining spots also. Very quick to reply to any communication after check-in also, much appreciated."

52920,8410937,446974326,2019-05-02,121229391,Gregory,Dave’s place is a great value.   We loved having his dogs around!   Dave is very detailed and straightforward in communication for check-in.  Thanks a bunch!
130645,18477255,174088065,2017-07-24,52575647,J.P.,"If I could give 6 stars, I would. Paul and his super host, G, have their system down to a science. They provide anything and everything one may need when away from home. A buddy and I stayed in this immaculate - and private - space one full weekend to catch 3 nights at Red Rocks. The recommendations G provides on things to do around Denver will have the locals thinking you were born and raised in Denver, Colorado. Thanks again for everything Paul & G!"

Our recommendations for places to check out would be:

Brunch/Dinner: 
Park: Confluence Park (they have live music sometimes!)
Ice Cream: Little Man Ice Cream
Coffee: LoHi Café "
98060,14741480,166809252,2017-07-04,133032068,Karen,"My husband, my 13 month old, and I stayed at Carolyn's for 3 nights. It was the perfect place to stay with our little one with the convenience of a full kitchen and laundry, as well as being one-level, room for a Pack N Play, and uncluttered. The location was a quick drive away from many of the different attractions/neighborhoods in Denver. Although it was street parking only, we never had any trouble finding a spot regardless of the time of day. We would definitely stay at Carolyn's again if we come back to Denver. "

The cozy house is exactly as pictured, and the four of us had a wonderful stay. We were in town for a wedding at Coors Field, which is in walking distance, as are several great restaurants and breweries though the house is located on a quiet street. For you beer nerds--at least three breweries are walkable, including Epic. Since we had great weather we walked almost everywhere, but the house is close to bus lines and a light rail line. This was one of the best airbnb experiences I've had, and I haven't had a bad one yet!"

They could not have been better hosts which became even clearer when we had several snowstorms during our stay and they shoveled us out three times! The bed is super comfortable and the big glass doors in the front room give the basement apartment lots of light and a sense of airiness. The tv room is great for relaxing in the evening. We look forward to returning to this sweet apartment on future visits to Denver.

It is close to the restaurants and shops on Broadway, but provides a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere.  Everything appears new and very clean.  The house is filled with light during the day, with views of trees out of several windows.  The owners have provided all of the amenities one might need for a short stay - no rushing out to buy anything (except food of course).  Cindy was very pleasant and easy to work with, and there is even a friendly kitty outside if you are missing your pets back home.  Thanks for a great stay!"

225213,31566077,403851576,2019-01-21,66804001,Allison,"This property is AWESOME! Aaron is an amazing host. 5 stars +++

I travel to Denver often for business and occasionally for fun. This particular trip was for business. The house is laid out really well for sharing space with coworkers or fellow travelers, so long as you don't mind stairs. There are 5 floors so you have the main living room area and kitchen on the second floor, then the bedrooms on floors above you. This was great for keeping the noise to a minimum when people start waking in the morning and everyone had their own private space on each floor.

We arrived late on the evening of check-in, which wasn't a problem at all. Aaron sent a door code so we could ""self-check-in."" This process was super easy, there is a digital keypad. Once in the property we gave it a quick once over to make sure we had everything we needed and that the property was in great shape;  which it was. The entire experience feels much like a hotel stay... from the ample and meticulously folded bath towels to the triangle folds on the toilet paper. There was even eco-friendly coffee pods for the Keurig in the morning. As someone that travels with large groups often I let you in on a tip, there is a drip coffee pot under the counter that's keeps you from having to wait for the everyone to use the Keurig (this is a very nice touch!) you'll need to bring coffee for the drip pot as there are only pods provided. There are several grocery stores close to the house King Soopers, Safeway, or Whole Foods. Aaron has a City Guide he'll send you before arrival that helps plug you in to the city right away.

Long story short:

We're already booked again for our next work trip this summer. Truly, the best Airbnb we've ever stayed in."

240870,36851163,566171446,2019-11-18,2684655,Julia,Great location and modern clean apartment. I booked for a friend and he only had positive things to say.
56922,8829680,333680648,2018-10-07,97849983,David,This was a beautiful space with a great view of downtown.  We had a rental car and parking was a little challenging in the area but you are no more than a 10 minute uber ride from basically anywhere in the city.  Nice modern feel and host was very responsive.
140048,19612462,435873330,2019-04-11,124476549,Hayley,"Francisco's place is super comfortable and clean.  Loved the memory foam pillows, easy check-in, laundry and having two full bathrooms."

200539,26500661,438875571,2019-04-17,25613993,Lenna,Allison and Ian are awesome! This place was super close to all the breweries and everything else in the RHINO district. They were even accomadating to let me leave my stuff there for a little longer while I went and explored the city!! Thank you.
110286,15902411,167167278,2017-07-05,131336300,Megan,"Very cute room. Jessica was lovely , open with communication and willing to share advice about best places to hike and eat! "

10986,1327856,190726105,2017-09-04,10080984,James,"My wife and I stayed at Leila and Alex's apartment in Denver over Labor Day weekend along with my parents and infant son (it was also his first birthday!).  Their apartment is gorgeous with plenty of space to relax either indoors or outside on the back deck.  We were also within walking distance to plenty of restaurants and activities in downtown Denver.  Leila saw to it that check-in and check-out were simple and easy, and having a garaged parking spot was nice so that we didn't have to worry about leaving our rental car on the street.  Staying here was a great value compared with two hotel rooms in the city and we had the advantage of a full kitchen and dining room to relax and prepare our own meals when we preferred.  Thanks for all of the hospitality!"
77369,12365447,544280357,2019-10-09,105274920,Nick,Patrick's place is just as described. We were able to park out front and walk everywhere we needed without any issues. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great time in Denver. Thanks again Patrick.
161218,21667826,456828495,2019-05-22,15774644,Dee,"This stylish second story apartment offers everything you need for a comfortable visit to Denver. Close to the city, but on a cul de sac with towering pine trees out the window. Stand alone space so no worries about your own or others’ noise. Comfortable everything — bed, couch, pillows. Fantastic shower. Tv with Netflix. Hosts were super warm and responsive. Coffee and drinks graciously provided. This is about my 12th Airbnb experience over four states and five years and it easily ranked as one of the best."
150454,20914531,281297131,2018-06-24,57827868,Emma,"This was a great priced place. Clean, modern and private! Great comunication as well."

131363,18550517,452276841,2019-05-12,112926598,Justin,The house was great for our guys trip to Denver. $8 Uber to the heart of downtown. As advertised.
118567,16857174,417004143,2019-02-25,18471894,Brandon,Rodney's place is well-located and very nice! Recommend.
16057,2257217,25182919,2015-01-08,24420565,Brittany,"This was our first Airb&b experience and it was wonderful. Beth was so nice and accommodating! She made it very easy for us to check in and out. The room was perfect for us (2 people). We went in January and the heaters worked great, the room warmed up quick and stayed warm all night. We stayed for one night and it was just what we needed. I would highly recommend any single  person or couple needing a quick place to stay or even longer to stay here. We will would stay here again if we come back to downtown Denver. Thank you Beth! And Zeke the cat was super sweet!"
182547,23960099,266848440,2018-05-20,81907552,Katie,"Willow is an exceptional host! I cannot say enough good things. The space was clean, cute, and in a great location. Quick responses, easy check-in, and thoughtful touches such as local favorite suggestions and breakfast ingredients in the fridge made this a great experience. Would love to stay here again!"
13920,1959836,11039694,2014-03-17,6127892,Amy,"Anne was a lovely and gracious host.  She's friendly and chatty, but also very good about maintaining space and privacy for the guest as well.  I was very comfortable, she has the best pillows on the bed!  The neighborhood is quiet, and easy to access, parking was no problem, and it was conveniently located.  I would stay here again!"
11473,1456614,122293550,2016-12-22,1493747,Debra,"Central location and close to many restaurants, hospitals and shopping.  Nice decor and setting."
144392,20211505,471012101,2019-06-16,19918331,Jeralyn,Leon’s place is amazing! I never leave reviews. But this was a great choice. We stayed 3 nights and was able to get everywhere in 20 minutes ... 25 tops. I would definitely book again!
242881,37916933,552792841,2019-10-22,74282954,Tracy,Don’t do it! Think about the low price and remember you get what you pay for. It was so bad that Airbnb put me up in La Quinta hotel. I would not put it past this “host” to attempt an attack on my character. No worries! Every other decent host would disagree. Get it together Nakita!
125821,17699020,207758315,2017-10-29,18494842,Rosemary,Loved Amanda and Christopher's home! Amanda's communication was excellent - she responded immediately to answer questions and even checked-in to make sure we had a smooth arrival. Everything was as expected and the home itself was cozy and in a great location for what we needed.
22594,3686629,328270218,2018-09-25,124427869,Elizabeth,"Really cool decor in a great location.  Access was easy to come and go as I needed.  Tons of amenities, including an iron which was a huge help for my work clothes that got wrinkled in travel.  Would stay again in a heartbeat!"
42160,6883917,120080228,2016-12-07,72373014,Megan,Quiet neighborhood and Gloria and Ryan are very friendly! I mostly kept to myself but they were happy to answer any questions. Would definitely stay here again. 
232918,33587660,532871892,2019-09-20,8293133,Nicole,"A beautiful, comfortable, clean space. Can not recommend this place enough. Great location, can walk to several cute neighborhoods and the apartment is spacious and bright. Particularly loved how comfortable the bed was! A fantastic stay, I will stay here anytime I’m in Denver!"

71001,11192056,134302727,2017-02-26,3278676,Charisse,Kinga's home was a great place to stay during our trip. Cute place with private balcony and parking available. We felt safe in a fun neighborhood and would definitely stay again in the future!
127570,18137155,194026000,2017-09-15,124279041,Desiree,Very quaint little place.  Centrally located in Denver with lots of entertainment and food options.
56064,8721578,516623013,2019-08-24,180399503,Anthony,Stephanie was very quick with responses and worked with us even having a very late check in with her hery accommodating.
88692,13656193,262086008,2018-05-07,50414498,Will,"I didn't have the opportunity to meet Jordan since I arrived late, but the self check in was convenient and the space was very clean. A good option for travelers looking to stay on the west side of Denver, with pretty easy access to I-70."
187930,24536074,308113078,2018-08-15,208340233,Mary,Bed was amazingly comfortable. Everything was clearly labeled. Not to far from downtown. 
180969,23740719,489444053,2019-07-16,92071383,Kali,"Of everywhere in the world we have been, this was by far the most homey and well prepared place we have stayed.  It was so quiet and we were able to walk nearly everywhere!  The place was so clean, didn’t have funky smells or sounds and was stocked beyond belief with things to make it feel comfortable.  We couldn’t recommend their Air BNB enough and will absolutely be returning!!  

And the hosts were amazingly efficient in check in and helping us with anything we could have needed in the Denver area."
51355,8211278,278319420,2018-06-17,3703134,Daniel,"Debbie and Stew are great hosts - very quick to respond, check-in was super easy. House was clean. Really good dive bar across the street for late nights when you get home. 

Layout of the house is pretty weird - two really small bathrooms, some bedrooms are connected to each other, no A/C, lots of light in the morning so hard to sleep in. It worked for our needs because there weren't many other options for 6 bedrooms."
208062,27953051,352703013,2018-11-25,214420559,Alice,"We live in the basement of the old house which is not told before , many others live there too,and the old lady always come to disturb,the host of the house ask us to pay for the leaking problem after we left, so ridiculous, I will never live again,"
214570,29259757,527392841,2019-09-10,290411969,Hannah,Great place. 15 min from downtown by Uber.
97158,14593779,248523031,2018-03-31,93317949,Kristin,"The location was perfect for us.   We visited Tenneyson street and the 16th street mall,  both were very easy to get to and had shops and cafes,  etc to explore.   During our stay we did hear their child crying on several occasions,  but seemed fairly quick to settle so it wasn't that much of a disruption.  Chuck also came down once at the beginning to check in and one other time to get something out of the storage area.  I tend to like complete privacy while staying at an airbnb, I don't even want to talk to anyone to check in, so him coming down twice and hearing their child cry a few nights in a row at bedtime was a bit much for me, but not totally unexpected since it is their basement.   I would stay there again because of the location."
102524,15174189,241328007,2018-03-08,17751849,Rajkumar,"Pamela is a wonderful host! She responds almost immediately to messages.
Her home is so bright and colorful. A super comfortable place close to LoDo!"
97645,14672294,238946354,2018-02-27,87345575,Everett,Absolutely a perfect location in downtown Denver. Has great restaurants within walking distance. Lyft or Uber’s aren’t more then 12 dollars if you need a ride. Home was very open and roomie.
70189,11080835,334946837,2018-10-10,75307867,Vladislav,I had a great experience with my stay at Rebecca's.  Very cozy and amazing hospitality.

21822,3487191,521214358,2019-08-31,255867854,Sarah,"The Carriage House is amazing! It's such a cozy, little place, perfect for a couple to stay a night or week. We really felt like we were at home instead of half way across the country in someone else's place. Nathen left us everything we could have asked for in order to have an enjoying stay.  The hospitality was amazing & the amenities were very handy! If we ever make it back to Denver, we'll definitely be  looking up the Carriage House again."
105966,15534324,212600858,2017-11-18,81272588,Jennifer,Kats house is fabulous!!! Highly recommend if you’re exploring Broadway and the Denver area! So much to see!

201581,26671491,339668659,2018-10-21,68605798,Kathleen,"Lunden was very responsive and attentive, friendly and polite. She was kind to allow us to check in very late--btwn 12:30 and 1am. Unfortunately, the room was in the basement (not advertised) and there was a very strong odor of air freshener like a glade plugin and we couldn't breathe. Due to that we were not able to stay, which we were very sorry about as her house looked so nice."
98200,14759489,192100534,2017-09-09,213959,Lehna,"Darren's space was wonderful, a nice quiet room and comfortable living room space, plus a great kitchen and communal area. The roof top deck was also very lovely on a warm summer night. The bed was very comfortable and the duvet cozy! The location is easy to get around from either by public transit or Lyft/Uber. 

Darren is a fabulous host! He was very communicative and friendly, with lots of helpful tips and a warm smile! Definitely recommended and will stay here again if I come back to Denver."

71065,11192056,204761866,2017-10-19,43524579,Lucas,Very accurate place matching with the announced. I do recommend Kingas Place.
184500,24101544,415447153,2019-02-22,244158310,Laura,"Fantastic spot. Parking was slightly difficult, however made up for by prevalent Uber/Lyft. Great place for work trip or pleasure!"
156469,21190064,287831897,2018-07-08,28764135,Austique,Good place to stay. Rachel is super nice!
113660,16238697,507672324,2019-08-11,162626471,Kathryn,"Any family that is going to travel to Denver would truly enjoy their stay at Nicole's place.  The location is ideal.  Home is excellent for a  family to come together in Denver and venture out hiking in the mountains, tour the Coors Brewery in Golden or go to a concert at Red Rocks!!!  You will be delighted."
201667,26685719,301729639,2018-08-04,168329024,Leslie,"Where do I even start! My friend and I went out to explore Denver.  Our flight got in about 1 in the morning. We got to the Airbnb it was super easy to get in and when we walked in it was clean and everything was ready for us to just go to sleep and they had a bottle of wine waiting for us knowing we had a rough travel experience. Once we got there everything was easy to find they had shampoo and body wash, available directions for the tv, and access to a washer and dryer. They gave us great recommendations on places to go around town as far as good places to go exploring. I would not hesitate to book with them again. If you’re on the fence you’ll be so glad you went with them! We sure couldn’t have had a better time!"
142066,19873257,222032950,2017-12-28,164295102,Vann,Place was a perfect short-term stay while I was scouting locations to live in Denver.  Very happy with the setup and convenience.  Would definitely stay again.
57447,8941796,135173771,2017-03-03,56632029,Lauren,"More spacious than I thought it would be.  Great lighting and nice space.  Close to some good restaurants for breakfast and dinner,  and a nice walk around a big Lake.  Also nice and quiet,  privacy because separate from their house.  New and updated space "
101055,15026012,110632710,2016-10-27,39846573,Derek,Shannon is an amazing person and made mommy stay more comfortable than I would have thought for an Airbnb! Best stay using Airbnb to date 
4177,629194,5483552,2013-07-02,2852775,Emily,"We found Juan's studio to be the perfect place for a young couple to stay.  The studio itself is spacious, private, extremely clean, well decorated and comfortable.  We felt at home right away.  There is the option to cook for yourself, if you want, as we did for most meals.  We were very happy with the location, it has a young vibe.  As my cousin (who lives within a mile of the studio) said, we were able to experience the ""real denver"" by staying in this location.  10 minutes walking can get you to a hip restaurant/bar scene or grocery store (sprouts is about a 10 min walk away down W 38th- like whole foods but seemed cheaper).  We chose to rent a car because our itinerary included a couple trips to boulder, so we didn't use public transit but there is a bus stop around the corner.   I would highly recommend this place to one person or a couple looking to feel like they live in Denver for a few days and aren't just tourists.  We would definitely stay here again!"
160433,21605545,219127640,2017-12-16,47397441,Iain,"Ben was a great host, very friendly, helpful & quick to respond to queries when booking. The apartment was immaculately refurbished, very spacious for a 1 bed apartment and in a great location for downtown Denver and surrounding areas. Close to lots of things like the zoo, botanical gardens, city park and the shops, restaurants etc around Colfax & Cherry Creek. I would highly recommend This apartment to anyone looking for a great central place to stay in Denver."

226622,31905174,488182251,2019-07-14,46977017,Stephen,Very clean and well decorated/appointed apartment.  Great to have the whole apartment to ourselves. Coffee in the back yard in the morning was nice. Perfect location. Parking space was also a big convenience.  Would definitely stay here again.
45952,7497461,505762361,2019-08-09,27049995,Joelle,"This space is in a great neighborhood in Denver! We really enjoyed the beer, restaurants, and ice cream in the area. The space is as described in the basement of the hosts home. Carly was easy to communicate with and accommodating with our check-in time which was nice. Would recommend the space."
103833,15302824,452666948,2019-05-13,4779869,Katherine,"Great spot. Highly recommended. Only downfall was the upstairs shower head wasnt working but bath worked just fine. Other than that little hiccup it was a great location, very clean, outside patio was super cozy. Thanks again."

88239,13560410,520623908,2019-08-30,269544875,Lorna,"It's tough to know where to begin when reviewing our stay with Matt and Robin.  To say they are Superhosts is an understatement.  From the moment we arrived, we felt at home.  Our questions were not only answered rapidly, but we were given so much information to help us get around that we were able to see and experience an enormous variety of sights and activities.  What made our visit extra special was the way these lovely people went out of their way to make us feel comfortable, and to make sure that all of our needs and even our wishes were met.  This was an Airbnb stay that we will talk about for years to come!  Thank you so very much, Matt and Robin!!"
70013,11080835,147271658,2017-04-25,400195,Kateryna,perfect place to stay!

The location was both great for cheap lyfts to bars/going out and for staying in to relax on the porch and with a private bathroom. The botanical gardens, park, and local coffee shops were great for walking. Pamela helped make my last minute travel plans a success and was just the right amount hands on."
127953,18153418,352709571,2018-11-25,170029577,Matthew,awesome place close to Mile High stadium!
213775,29063041,535557599,2019-09-24,201917155,Alexandra,"The apartment is clean, spacious and modern. It is even bigger than I perceived in photos. Bed was super comfy. 

The apartment is on the border of a part of the city with questionable safety. I would not have felt comfortable walking alone at night as a solo woman but my hubby and I walked it together. The unit itself is very secure, with two passcodes and cameras outside. On the second floor, it is right next to the stairwell. As someone who is typically safety wary (ok, maybe a worrywart) I felt VERY safe inside this unit. 

The only neighbor noise we heard was in the kitchen area, and briefly. If you’re a sensitive sleeper, bring an eye mask and earplugs. There was a fair amount of urban noise pollution— really not bad but enough to wake us up with the windows closed on a weekday morning. 

We stayed at this place midway through a 10 day trip across CO, so laundry was needed. The machines worked well and we were very happy to have been supplied with Tide Pods. It was so homey and convenient to be able to do laundry from the comfort of the unit. 

Parking was convenient- 2 hour streetside parking between 8 am and 6 pm— which we took to mean that we didn’t need to move our car between 4 pm and 10 am. There was only one spot when we arrived at 4 on a weekday but practically the whole street cleared by 8/10 pm. We didn’t get ticketed. Right across the street is a large lot which we heard was $11 all day parking.  

I had a great stay at Noe’s place and would highly recommend!"
87308,13494022,165725596,2017-07-02,27179238,Jenna,Very clean and Jacob was great at communicating. He answered my calls right away. Lots of room for travelers to sleep! Very accommodating overall.  The neighborhood is very close to many restaurants and bars. It was amazing to be able to walk 2 minutes to a show at the ogden. 
1294,39405,68829009,2016-04-07,2750903,Jack,"Comically small apartment, uncomfortable bed, and not super clean.  I recommend staying here only if it's a bargain - like $60 or less.  I paid over $100 a night and was very disappointed.  (Even though the hosts were lovely and the location very convenient.)  

Everything in this apartment is in miniature - which is not clear from the photos.  There is no real couch.  There is no room in the bathroom to towel off.  (I had to do so by the front door.)  The doorways are low, so if you are over 6' you will have to duck.  The TV is a tiny old unit tucked away on a bookshelf in the corner.  And the only place to sit comfortably is at a tiny folding table in front of the bathroom.  

The bed is hard and uncomfortable.  It is a simple foam mattress sitting on a piece of plywood, supported by a large wooden box. It slept more like a cot.  I felt like I was camping.  

On the plus side, the location was excellent.  The garden outside was rustic but inviting.  Parking was easy, and the drive to downtown was just a few minutes.  Jennifer and Gio were warm, friendly, and easy to communicate with.  Unfortunately, these positives were outweighed by the negatives. This was a disappointing stay."
170545,22529249,423621277,2019-03-14,33517172,Jose,Can't go wrong with this place it has an amazing location and it's very comfortable.

Donna and Patrick are easy to communicate with, responsive and very hospitable. 
Their basement included private bathroom and nice touches like a Keurig and snacks."
136037,19120931,508307204,2019-08-12,15574846,Nicole,"Sheri was incredibly warm and welcoming to us. We flew into Denver for a family emergency and she was compassionate and went above and beyond when we needed to book another night unexpectedly. Her two dogs were sweethearts and they made being away from our dog a little easier and helped the way only dogs can. 
The space was clean, a fan was provided for additional comfort on top of the AC (kept at a comfortable cool temp on summer nights), and the bathroom was very cute. The whole house is quaint and adorable and Sheri was kind enough to give us access to the fridge and kitchen as needed. 
We were also within walking distance to plenty of places to eat, or just an Uber drive away. Thank you again Sheri for everything!"
24438,3968613,548094954,2019-10-16,74633673,Jess,"Erika is an awesome host with a beautiful home. The room was clean and cozy and had everything I needed. Erika was fun to chat with and gave great recommendations in the neighborhood—which has plenty of its own restaurants and gorgeous streets to walk around, while being a quick trip away from downtown. I was able to walk and use transit to get everywhere I wanted. Such a great place!"

59969,9169151,536965617,2019-09-27,50294603,Abri,"I would definitely recommend staying here. I stayed here for a week, and everything was perfect.  The space was clean, spacious and very organized. The bed was super comfortable. I love taking hot hot showers and the water got really hot and had great water pressure.  They had informative books laying around for you to indulge in. I got there very early and they allowed me to leave my bags on their porch until the room was ready. Next time I am in Denver I will more than definitely try to stay here.

The neighborhood of Sloan lake had everything you need, great food spots, bars, a target, and dispensaries everywhere. Sloan lake is such a beautiful neighborhood. There are electric scooters and bikes for you to get around if you don't plan on renting a car. Walks around the lake are beautiful. 

 Liz was a great host."

The house is in a great location; lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance and an easy drive to the mountains. Quick tip- if you can't find a dish you need, check in the dishwasher! It was full of clean dishes which we only figured out on our last day. Overall loved this place and would definitely stay here again."

The pictures were beautiful but once we arrive the house was even more beautiful!    There isn’t a detail that Gretta missed.  The house is stocked better than my own home and there wasn’t a thing missing!  We cooked and grilled everyday, didn’t have a need to eat out.  Backyard corn hole and comfy gathering space.  The neighborhood is beautiful and easy access to anywhere in Denver. This will be our go to home in Denver from now on! Thank you Gretta!!!"

6713,769437,125934690,2017-01-08,25393555,Alyssa,"This was a great place to stay and Simone is a perfect host. My boyfriend and I stayed here for a short vacation full of exploring around Denver. The location is ideal and exactly as described. We were able to walk to plenty of bars and restaurants in 15 minutes or less, could take the bus from a stop right around the corner from the house, or could easily uber/lyft for about $9 to downtown. We weren't at the house much but Simone made communication easy and went above and beyond to accomodate us. She also gave great recommendations! Simone's place is also probably the cleanest airbnb I have stayed at. I would stay here again if traveling to Denver."

We had no trouble parking our rental car on the street, and pretty much walked wherever we needed to go.  RiNo was close enough to walk to.  Other places that Leanne suggested, like the Beet Box Bakery and Birdcall are only a few blocks away. Note there is a great NY bagel place nearby called Rosenberg's.  The apartment was very clean and I loved that it was keyless entry. I was excited that there was rose jasmine oil in the bathroom, plus a hair dryer,  curling iron and hair spray.

Alex was a great host who communicated well with us.  She had lots of great recommendations of places to go for food, drinks, and fun.

Paul & Laurel are terrific folks, whose space mirrors that of CO -  serene,  possessing a natural beauty, and most importantly peaceful.  While it is in a suburban enclave, the house is a place onto itself.  Custom built, that's a stand out, but doesn't stand out -  it's a haven, which is hidden from the street ......I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, 
Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight
     - Billy Shakespeare

The studio itself, is spacious, immaculate and has all the amenities one needs to be comfortable and happy.  The backyard is amazing and it abuts the Bear Creek Greenway.  It's also within 10 minutes of Red Rocks, along with its location on the western edge of Denver allowing for good launch points west and avoiding Denver traffic.  We love this place. So will you. "

The house is one of the cute 1920ish bungalows Denver is known for. They remodeled and upgraded the interior and it's just gorgeous! Checkin was easy and they were quick to respond to questions. We loved all the special touches and our bedroom was so comfortable. It's so nice to have your own bathroom connected to your room. We had a very short stay because we had to get to work the next day and didn't get to meet them, but we could feel the hospitality. We would definitely stay with them again!"

163347,21811514,360438284,2018-12-20,168244734,Teddy,"This place is even better than the photos can show! It is in a great area of Denver, super close to downtown, the stadium, and great restaurants. We stayed there for 5 nights and I could not be happier about our choice."

80811,12970037,312085042,2018-08-22,94866205,Andrew,This place is one of the best you’ll find in Denver at what I found to be an appropriate price. Preston and Jan have paid close attention to detail; their place is inviting and extremely comfortable. The location is great and they gave great recommendations for local activities/eats. I will always look for this place first when I’m in town. 
140514,19671778,274251611,2018-06-08,64115470,Jenny,"Thank you, Pemba for a great stay. It was a lovely room and super easy to find. Great instructions to get in even though our flight was late and we didn’t get to arrive till close to 2am. Will definitely recommend!!"
22189,3605358,20841152,2014-10-06,20325278,Mark,"My wife and I stayed here for a nice kid-free weekend.  Unfortunately, we did not get to meet Georgia on our trip, but our stay was fantastic none the less.   The location was perfect - a short walk thru a beautiful neighborhood to some great restaurants, and easy walking distance to 16th street mall.  

The accommodations were great.  The bed was super comfortable, and the suite was very roomy.  The bathroom was very spacious with plenty of room, and the on-suite laundry came in handy.

We would definitely stay here for future trips."

86613,13474217,122941159,2016-12-26,49186911,Kevin,"We had a perfect stay here. The purpose was to have a central space to celebrate Christmas for three days with our four children, who all live in Denver. There was plenty of room for cooking and serving meals for 10. Very comfortable beds. And you can have excellent food delivered from downstairs when you're too tired to cook. And wine too when you plan poorly! We had some bar noise in one bedroom in the evenings, but it didn't keep us from sleeping at all. We can't imagine staying anywhere else now when we're in Denver. Loved the ""Colfax shower"". You'll have to stay here to know what that means. Kinga rocks!"

239409,36036522,546420674,2019-10-13,243710581,Adrianne,"Great place! Very clean, the host provided coffee and oatmeal for us. Was definitely smaller than the pics made it appear, but that wasn't an issue for us. Location was great, parking was easy. Only issue was when we arrived, all the windows were open and there is only one small heater, so it took a little while to warm up. Other than that the place was fantastic, would recommend!"
244002,38717548,536895010,2019-09-27,54659778,Taylor,"I highly recommend staying here! The units was so clean and modern, and Jenna added a few touches that made it a great stay. The location is amazing just a few blocks from bars and restaurants, as well as downtown. Jenna was very responsive and was willing to do anything to make my stay perfect. Looking forward to coming back soon!"

I asked for suggestions and recommendations of places to see and eat, and he gave me tons of options and recommendations! Very quiet neighborhood everything is walkable and easy to get to. I’d definitely stay here again."
73560,11676326,213369795,2017-11-20,88752428,Michelle,"Staying at Dee’s place was the perfect choice for my 5 day stay in Denver for a training - 5 minute drive to the training location, comfortable, welcoming, very enjoyable. Dee was easy to talk with and fun to hang with as I decompressed after a full day. And I got a good night of sleep each day - very pleased and grateful!"

85049,13300432,168927665,2017-07-10,20334928,Derrick,"This place is nice, small and quaint for a couple. The couple really helps you find the place and their folder is super convenient. However, there is only one air con. It's in the living room and programmed to stop at 62 degrees. The other rooms have nothing but ceiling fans and it's super hot to sleep in the master bedroom if you haven't kept the air con on all day and closed all doors except the bedroom. The kitchen is nice and there is plenty of food. We were excited because after staying in a really nice house on the other side of the park for my brothers. Wedding we wanted something small and nice. The couple seemed adorable and very informed however, if you need a cool place, I'd bring a fan. The one they offer is SUPER loud! "

129986,18377729,176385180,2017-07-30,20890011,Haley,"This house is very nice on the inside although the exterior is a little bit foreboding. It's comfortable and furnished well enough. As long as you can manage the single bathroom and one room which doesn't have it's own AC unit I highly recommend this place.  It's close enough to downtown (only a short uber ride away) and there are tons of restaurants in the area within walking distance, which we really appreciated. 

Dan was also very congenial and easy to get ahold of."

Because it is in a basement, you can hear the guests upstairs but turning on the fan made the noise fade away. The kitchen was full of everything you needed to make your stay comfortable and feel like home. I would absolutely stay here again - for business and personal travel! Thanks for a great stay, Sarah!"

220889,30530431,498431956,2019-07-29,55041543,Liz,"Fantastic spot for 5 of us for the weekend.  We cooked most of the nights and were grateful for a very well-stocked kitchen. I’ve stayed at a lot of air bnb’s and I give the kitchen functionality a solid 2 !  The  porch and location were added perks.  We were originally going to have more folks, but 5 was a perfect amount given the single bathroom and a tighter schedule for our Denver trip.  Thanks for a great trip, we recommend this place!"
228422,32317445,463150034,2019-06-02,253821911,Tana,"Beds are super comfy! Bathroom was attractive and clean with excellent shower pressure! The location was great (centrally located) for everything we visited. The private driveway for parking is fantastic! We very much appreciated the fully equipped kitchen and dining table. Arriving late a night proved slightly intimidating due to other neighborhood residents, however no concerns during the daytime."

57177,8884899,81590514,2016-06-24,792263,Deirdre,"The apartment was adorable and charming, just as described. Arianne responded to all messages very quickly! She has a helpful list of restaurants and bars within walking distance of her place, and the few I checked out were nice. The pool is next door and locked, so make sure you get the key or have a neighbor let you in like I did! "
124123,17497576,361836573,2018-12-24,34268276,Alexandra,"This place definitely was great for our first trip to Denver. It’s close to a lot of restaurants and has a parking place for $6 a day around the corner. If you want to go skiing, it’s a bit far but totally worth the trip."

He let us have guests over to celebrate and was very accommodating. The neighborhood was fantastic and we were never bored. Hooked on Colfax quickly became a favorite of ours. The house was clean and exactly as advertised. We would absolutely stay with Travis again."

Ashley and her friends were helpful and quick to respond - they even let us check in a few hours early! The house and grounds had plenty of great spaces for hanging, and the rooms were very nice.

180755,23696085,264429928,2018-05-13,68300070,Roman,"Cole & Julie’s place was the perfect setting for our group. The place was nicely decorated with modern touches and had all the necessities needed for a group our size, and some additional features we weren’t expecting which was a plus. The outside patio was a perfect space to be outside and offered an amazing view of Mile High Stadium. The walk to the stadium was a breeze and there were a few restaurants nearby, which made it convenient. The downtown nightlife is a short and cheap Uber ride away, too. I would highly recommend this place for larger groups with sleeping space for everyone and good amount of entertaining areas."
204428,27314379,354940995,2018-12-02,7253091,Erin,"Shelly is a wonderful host! Friendly and accommodating, she made sure I had exactly what I needed! 

The room is cozy and welcoming, and the hot tub is glorious! Just right to end the day. The kitchenette was great, so nice to have a fridge to store my leftovers from dinner and to make a cup of coffee in the morning. 

I will definitely be back!! Thank you, Shelly!"
25416,4067759,40041554,2015-07-27,39132374,Lori,"Erika was a great host and her place is perfectly located.   It is just 2 blocks from the trendy Highland neighborhood which is an eclectic mix of old and new homes, restaurants and retail stores.   I liked it better than downtown.  But downtown is only about 2 miles and it is a fun walk. You cross the river bridge, go over the suspension bridge and thru the park and you are in downtown. I would recommend staying at Erika pad if you want a real local Denver experience....and Erika is very nice and her place is artsy and very comfortable. "
107399,15746223,133147570,2017-02-20,55802175,Natalie,"Perfect spot for exploring the city of Denver. Everything is a short Uber or Lyft drive away (Downtown, breweries, etc.). The spot is super cozy, although it is small. I would definitely be aware of that if you are tall. My husband and I are both 5'11"" so we bumped our heads once each. However, the value is great for what you get! We had a nice time watching movies and playing board games when we weren't out and about. Eva was a wonderful host, she was prompt to respond to our needs and flexible with our arrival and departure times. I would definitely stay again! "

211189,28545094,547141712,2019-10-14,87762855,Ashley,"This was my first time staying in a hostel. As a woman I can say that I felt safe staying here, which is something I was worried about. The place is clean, the staff was friendly and accommodating and had security overnight. It was an added bonus to have a bar in the hostel with a free drink every night during happy hour. It was a great way to meet new people and socialize. For women who aren’t so crazy about bunking with men, they do have women only rooms... and a blow dryer in case you need one. Would definitely recommend staying here."
93087,13972526,99653170,2016-09-05,55270457,Kae,"So glad we got to meet and stay in Karina and Patrick’s home. They truly are wonderful and friendly people. Made us feel right at home the second we stepped into their lovely home. The bathroom was fully stocked with items we needed for our stay, fresh linens and towels as well as backups if we needed were waiting for us. They left us a welcoming note and information on everything that we needed for our stay and more. I fell in love with Denver while staying in their home and can’t wait to come back. The convenience and location of their home was the best part of the trip. A quick ride away from the airport, about 15 minutes to the Red Rock Amphitheater, 15/20 minutes to downtown Denver. Surrounding shops and markets are a 3-4 min drive and so close that I walked to the local Walmart and shops to enjoy the nice weather we had during our visit. Situated on a hill, there were great views of the Red Rock Amphitheater and of course the famous Rocky Mountains of Colorado. The neighborhood is so so so cute and most importantly very safe. I jogged in the mornings/evenings and was greeted by friendly neighbors who waved hello and smiled as I passed by. We made a quick trip to Boulder which took us a little under an hour and WOW, the views along the drive were great. Karina gave great recommendations on where and what to do in the area and her recommendations did not disappoint. My favorite view was the view from their backyard because for me there's no better way to spend my morning than by lounging on a patio with a cup of coffee in my hand while looking at the mountains. We had such a great time that we already booked our next flight and stay with Karina for the winter for skiing. See you guys soon! HOSPITALITY A+++"

The location was perfect. Close to everything Downtown, and a super short walk to lots of tourist-y things in Denver (16th Street Mall, Union Station, ect). 
The space was clean and very well taken care of. 
Spacious, thoughtful touches and a great view. 
Amenities of the building were wonderful.

The house is as beautiful as it looks in those photos if not more. She also answered all my questions even before I thought of them and it made me feel right at home knowing where to find things I might need during the stay. She is also very knowledgable about the area and can give you plenty of recommendations for restaurants and bars. It really helped me to get familiar wit the area. We went to a wonderful breakfast place she recommended and really loved it. Lastly, we had some unexpected changes to our traveling plans and Erika was very accommodating with our last minute change. I cannot be more pleased booking with Erika. She definitely is a great host and I am sure you will love the house! I cannot recommend this place more. If you are looking for a homey place with a welcoming host, this is it. "

He has everything you need as far as amenities.  The TVs are HUGE and he has plenty Xfinity channels to keep you entertained. The bed was super soft! He provides a garage parking space which is a great added bonus to those renting cars and wanting to feel secure about their car. His communication was very fast, responsive and accurate. There’s a big balcony for you to get some fresh air and “Chill”. Lastly it located only 15 mins from city center.I can’t wait to book this place again."

It was our first time to Denver, and we were pleasantly surprised how convenient it was to just walk to all the top spots! So close to Coors field.  The rental was just as described, and we enjoyed how the owner made use of all the space so creatively!"
17982,2723629,89830587,2016-07-30,17014450,Tracy,"Ellen was a wonderful host. She never hesitated to make us feel welcome in her charming home and adjoining garden. The mile walk to the convention center was enjoyable. The neighborhood, although mixed in redevelopment, is both quiet and safe. I would love to stay here again. "
147698,20617423,414779082,2019-02-20,89738987,Jovahn,"Great little apartment in a conveniently located neighborhood. If you're visiting Denver for a couple days (solo or couple), you can't go wrong with this one."
205803,27551943,535172981,2019-09-23,94092839,Jonathan,The place was great and more than we could have asked for. Perfect place for a couple who is looking to explore Denver and have everything you need. Bekah was super responsive and thoughtful during our stay! I would stay here again in a heartbeat and recommend friends to stay in their home as well! Thanks for everything Bekah!
32304,4951295,194862714,2017-09-17,17873637,Darla,"Really nice place. There is an additional occupancy tax (in addition to listing price) once request has been sent - look in description for more info. Two cruiser bikes available. Would recommend using the bikes on the side walks for safety purposes as traffic and other bikes are quick. Side walks are a little bumpy! Location great for City Park and Cheesman Park. It's a little far from Five Points and Highlands, etc so not really walkable to those areas. However, FANTASTIC hosts and super nice place with awesome bed. Footsteps can be heard upstairs but it's not bad."
209686,28137750,493548793,2019-07-22,102282135,Lisa,Beautiful house. Super clean and comfy.  A perfect place to stay before heading to the airport!
27505,4263661,286177575,2018-07-05,173737543,Haley,Super cozy and comfortable place to stay. Has a nice downstairs area with a TV to relax before bed right outside the bedroom. Perfect place for any couple to stay!
225022,31520049,564402009,2019-11-15,285471199,Jennifer,A great place to stay and extremely close to Detour Bakery —a great place to grab an authentic French pastry.
78339,12685709,99775902,2016-09-05,28187801,Nick,Arrival was easy. The space was clean and large with a nice rooftop deck. Karl was as available or as hands off as you'd like him to be.

40224,6488535,35505393,2015-06-19,35000596,Erynne,"I cannot imagine that there is a better listing available in Denver! 

First of all, the location was out of this world. I had never been to Denver before, but on the recommendation of a friend I looked around the S. Broadway/Wash Park area and found Brandon's place and just went for it. So glad I did! I didn't have a rental car on my trip, and yet I ate at a different restaurant for every meal, all of them within walking distance! Speaking of which- I was traveling solo, and not once did I feel unsafe walking around the neighborhood or surrounding streets. Very lovely residential feel.

As for the apartment itself, it was even better than the photos could show. Completely renovated, clean, and beautiful. Also, tons of windows, so it was just so bright and sunny, I almost didn't mind that I was spending most of my days working away on my laptop (which reminds me- props to their WIFI! It held up like a champ, even through video conferences). 

Last, but absolutely not least, is the host himself, Brandon! He absolutely could not have been more gracious, responsive, and thoughtful. Getting on my flight out to Denver and getting into town was hectic and I hadn't eaten yet that day and was starving, so walking into the apartment and seeing a bowl of snacks waiting on the counter was like seeing the holy grail. Seriously, Brandon, thank you so much for all of the nice touches you put into making your guests feel welcome! I could not recommend this place more. "
236613,34715139,560378882,2019-11-06,22279071,Gloria,Great place to stay!

62567,9496966,548089916,2019-10-16,21706524,Tuyet,"Kinga is such a wonderful host! Communication was top notch. Her responses were always quick, sweet and helpful! (which is not always easy to do when you run multiple businesses). 

The apartment is very spacious and beautiful! I loved the location and the ease of getting in and out. Even though it’s above a restaurant/bar, we couldn’t hear the people downstairs at all.  It was very quiet and felt very private. 

If you stay here, check out the lounge and try some tasty polish  food! We had the pierogi sampler and polish crepes and they were DELICIOUS! 

Thanks, Kinga, for the champagne and cold water upon arrival and thanks for letting us stay at your place! It made our anniversary trip very special!"
13344,1792152,92164350,2016-08-07,4970436,Karen,"This was our second stay at Rita's. She's a first class host with a charming, comfortable house in an ideal Denver neigborhood."

The location is walkable to downtown, and there are a few bus routes that head that direction.   The basement was super cozy and it was nice to have a private space since I worked from home on the weekdays. Amy was a great host.   In addition to giving me a lift from the train, there were complimentary snacks and beverages.     "

Although there were a lot of rules coming up to the trip, I appreciate the cleanliness and decor of the house."
143386,20027486,339564619,2018-10-21,26551055,Rachael,"Michelle's place is a perfect home base if you plan on exploring the area around Denver. We really appreciated the personal touches (coffee, candy, bug spray, etc.)."

18604,2942068,28146546,2015-03-18,9210775,Susan,"Danno and Rachel were fine hosts and very cooperative about check-in and check-out times. We met them for a beer (thanks!!) but then did not see them. There was another roommate for just part of the time. The house and location were great. The room was private, back of the house. We really enjoyed our stay, especially being able to use the table and chairs on the back porch on some of Denver's nicer days. The neighborhood church bells were fun and it was around the corner to some art galleries, where we chanced upon an opening one night. Not too far to walk to Root Down either. Easy and quick bus service to Union Station and downtown or along 38th."
145549,20309642,563368770,2019-11-12,46473072,Anna,Heather’s place was awesome! I highly recommend.

113682,16258368,269652073,2018-05-27,41214161,Linda,"This gorgeous Victorian is in a superb location that was super walkable to nearby restaurants, microbreweries, and more. The place was unique, well-equipped and spacious. Our hosts had several recommendations and had a convenient parking spot for us. 

Our only complaint was that we didn’t think the bed was comfortable, but that could be personal preference."
81808,12991472,401495397,2019-01-14,163683770,Ashley,"Our stay was perfect. There were so many touches we didn’t expect from chargers in every room, a sound machine in the bedroom, to the incredibly comfortable bed. The area is close to restaurants and multiple breweries. The Denver Central Market was a personal favorite. Douglas was an excellent host, who was quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had. You will not be disappointed by staying here."
38564,6333040,47469159,2015-09-19,14979578,Colleen,We had a super time in Denver staying at the carriage house.  Many thanks to Mick & Patrick for sharing their beautiful space with us.

Matt was flexible with our check in/check out time. He was always willing to provide us with great recommendations and quickly responded to any inquiries that we had. We only wish that we could have stayed longer. 
10135,1127235,442112961,2019-04-22,135119388,Christopher,"This is a relaxing and comfortable place. Bob provided most necessities (shampoo, dishes, towels, toilet paper, etc) and was readily available to assist us via text/calling when we had questions/concerns. He let us check-in early and check-out late to accommodate us for our flight times. The house is in a convenient location near the city, and a short drive away from some great sights. The exterior appeared as if it hadn't been taken care of in a while, but this did not impact our stay.  I definitely recommend this place to others!"

Having use of the garage to park our vehicle was an amazing perk. The house was clean and so charming. We had absolutely everything we needed during our stay. Access to the home was easy and swift. We enjoyed exploring and enjoying all of the incredible restaurants and bars in the area which made this homes location really hard to beat. The backyard patio was inviting and the upstairs patio provided a great view of the area. We would have spent so much more time enjoying the outdoor spaces if it hadn’t of snowed on us during our stay. I would book this Airbnb again in a heartbeat."

52799,8410937,78337652,2016-06-06,67767252,Faith,Dave was very good about communicating upon arrival and was flexible with our check in time. We were especially thankful of his acceptance of our old black lab- she wasn't a fan of smaller dogs and barked a little at his cute smaller house dog. Room and bathroom as pictured- a little warm in the room but we were able to adjust window unit A/C appropriately. This area of Denver was a little rough but the Airbnb was worth the money!
171827,22687385,361503933,2018-12-23,9930460,Robert,Flor was so helpful and even accommodate my late arrival which was fantastic. The neighborhood is super quiet and about a 8min cab ride from downtown and 15min from red rocks. When I come back to denver i hope this bnb is available. I would definitely rent this place again. Couldn't ask for a better host.
239057,35879415,495898550,2019-07-26,125439661,Michelle,"I highly recommend Phuoc Dung’s. It was a perfect location for an early morning flight. It’s less then 15 min. From the airport, there are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby, and it’s new, large and clean. Thanks again for having us!"
132434,18753893,249099289,2018-04-01,9289216,Carly,This home is absolutely stunning.  The neighborhood can not be beat.  You are walking distance from everything you could possible want to experience while in Denver.

The home itself was very beautiful and the host Kelly and Rob went out of their way to welcome us. 

I can’t imagine booking a nicer place for such a great rate."

I would definitely recommend to stay at Claudia & Jeremy."
155080,21126734,206105572,2017-10-23,36214083,Doryus,"Amazing communication from the day Jacob accepted our request to stay. The location is in quick proximity to everything; If you decide to drive it's a straight shot to everywhere (we stopped using GPS because it was that easy), If you don't drive you can walk to some of the best spots in Denver. The house was top notch; clean and comfortable... extremely conformable. The layout is nice too the slight upstairs down separation was so cool.  The fridge was stocked with some of the best beverages too. HIGHLY RECOMMEND Jacob's places! This place is a WIN!"

So many little things he thought of! The only thing I would suggest is to bring WARM pajamas because it’s a basement, so it’s FREEZING. He does has a tiny little heater and blankets available though. Bed was huge and comfy. Same as couch. Netflix and Hulu available, no cable. If you like to take the bus, it’s a good spot for you, but I’m too lazy to do that so I spent quite a bit of money on Uber/Lyft. Overall nice place to stay."
229932,32746862,471495013,2019-06-17,10800521,Josie,"Great location in Highlands! Close to great restaurants, boutiques, bars and a Sunday farmers market!  Host was super helpful and the place is incredible. I went with my boyfriend and 2 other couples and we absolutely loved our weekend in Denver and having the Stylish Highlands Oasis to call ""home"" during our trip!"
88847,13656193,536920683,2019-09-27,135584313,Gina,"Jordan and Jason have a beautiful and inviting home that is located in a convenient area just outside of downtown. We really enjoyed our stay there. It was clean and thoughtfully curated. We didn’t get the chance to meet Jason, but Jordan was a great host and provided suggestions for bars and restaurants we should check out. We will definitely look up their space in our future trips to Denver."
141488,19788066,275787258,2018-06-11,35384191,Jeremiah,This place is in a great neighborhood and close to all of the downtown Denver action. The place was super clean and comfortable. The host had spot on communication as well.
127534,18133714,159773793,2017-06-11,126675960,Connie,The house was perfect for our weekend in Denver. It is within waking distance of a grocery store and 2 coffee shops. We took our own lawn chairs and sat out on the front porch in the evenings which was very nice. We didn't meet Shannon but she communicated check in instructions and left check out instructions which were both easy to follow.
150949,20920175,319508746,2018-09-06,76745375,Vonna,Very cozy place. The bed wasn’t that comfortable but the space was very nice. Centrally located to most of Denver’s best.
24898,3992779,137649018,2017-03-16,36797408,Linda,I really enjoyed my stay at Elizabeth's. She greeted us when we arrived and showed us our way to the unit. It's a very cute small space but efficient. We had everything we needed and more. The neighborhood is safe and I felt comfortable walking to the nearby coffee shops and restaurants. She also checked in on us to make sure we were doing alright. I hope to return soon! 
70039,11080835,168541004,2017-07-09,126036294,Victoria,"Rebecca is an amazing host, very welcoming and friendly! Her location is only a few minutes away from downtown Denver which is a huge plus!

80572,12953524,197095688,2017-09-24,135567037,Stacey,"We loved the spacious townhouse, the views, hot tub  and the location was perfect . It was everything we wanted. We had a wonderful time!"
158027,21343580,515888329,2019-08-23,1991918,Kristina,"Zana responded to my questions very quickly, which I really appreciated during my stay in Denver. The location is close to the university and very easily accessible to other parts of the city. It’s a basement apartment so there might be a few spiders and a bit of noise, but the overall value was very good."
138433,19436429,353113905,2018-11-26,117520891,Erin,"This house is decorated so cute and is very clean. The backyard is wonderful even though it was too cold for us to use it. If we are ever there in the summer we will probably be in that backyard the whole time.  Great location, we were able to get to all the places we were going in about 15 minutes. Loved our stay and Emmy and Cameron were wonderful hosts."
100398,14962389,324138625,2018-09-16,53321269,Nick,Great place especially for a large group. Hosts are very helpful!

40546,6488535,481979401,2019-07-05,226414088,Stephen,"Brandon & Roberts place was amazing and located in an awesome neighborhood walkable to plenty of bars and restaurants and also within reasonable distance to the ballpark. They were amazing hosts that even invited me out to a bbq they were having. If available, I will definitely stay here again on my next visit. Thanks Brandon and Robert for the awesome experience!"
53812,8474753,302597226,2018-08-05,196937924,Jeff,"This is a very clean, fun spot in a great location, within walking distance of some great Denver locations. There’s easy, private access and plenty of street parking. Our stay would have been perfect but for the frequent barking of the resident dogs. "
115183,16404214,323496565,2018-09-15,6306749,Danielle,"The photos of this lovely house does not do it justice. My favorite part of the home is the garden patio out back. The perfect spot for drinking coffee in the morning and catching up on all of the days events in the evenings. Also to note, this could not be in a more perfect part of the city. My friends woke up every morning for a beautiful run in the park, and we were within walking distance or a 10$ uber ride from anything & everything we wanted to do! A number of restaurants, bars, and amazing coffee shops within a block or two, and the perfect souvenir shop, Coloradical, directly across the street. We will definitely be back. A couple of our favorite spots within a block or two...Hooked On Colfax, Machete Tequila & Tacos, and Pete’s."

199057,26281251,476685813,2019-06-26,17577860,Karina,"Beautiful and spacious space! Lovely older house that’s been completely updated while keeping the original charm. Perfect location to walk through city park to the museum of nature and science, among many other  restaurants, shopping, etc. Comfy beds, awesome reading nook and beautiful bathrooms. Wouldn’t have changed a thing and would definitely stay again!"
11886,1594161,471552102,2019-06-17,5758778,York-Peter,"We stayed in Tarryn and Brian's place for two weeks and it was perfect for us (2 adults and a 1 year old). The apartment is in the basement, but there is plenty of light coming in through the windows. Getting into the apartment through their kitchen is no issue at all. The place is spacious and clean and has everything you need. There are also plenty of toys and books, a highchair and a travel cot for younger children. The location was quiet and very convenient. There are lots of shops nearby, Sloan's lake park is just around the corner and the train into town is only a 10 minute walk away. Tarryn and Brian were very helpful and gave us some local tips. We definitely recommend this place!"
242659,37888182,526400848,2019-09-08,153278438,Lauren,Beautiful space and very friendly!
148106,20673489,223764893,2018-01-01,19644175,Reagan,Kyle’s place was a great spot for us for a couple days of wedding activities for our friend’s wedding. He was responsive to my questions and very helpful host.
212998,28960222,476224582,2019-06-25,59535654,Silvia,"Location is great if you are looking to stay near airport. I would recommend this place if you plan on having a rental car to get around. I utilized Uber/Lyft a few times and averaged between 12-25$ per ride, the cheapest ride being from the airport. It is a small room with bed so it worked out for me as I was out and about all day and returned to rest. Check in was very easy, neighborhood was safe and quiet.

Comfortable stay."
244590,39253203,564799085,2019-11-16,51768652,Stephen,"This is a great place to take your significant other, if your spending a short time in Denver for like a weekend or something like that. It’s right in the heart of LODO and the views are amazing. Your right next to all the amazing bars, restaurants and night life as well. The space is clean and comfortable and Frederico is very quick to respond and accommodating. The only downside is that the due to the proximity of Union Station, the trains make it a little loud. I’d recommend earplugs if your a light sleeper."
108430,15802763,198522800,2017-09-29,8956956,Tony,"Great spot, walked to ballpark, union station and Rino easily. Very cool place"
12012,1637744,48825477,2015-09-28,38114137,Diana,Jennifer was a gracious host only overshadowed by her even cozier & warm home. The room was larger and homier than expected. Closely located to a main avenue & public transportation. I loved everything about my stay. I look forward to reaching out to Jennifer next time I'm in Denver.
50685,8071897,147967047,2017-04-29,19698640,Matthew,"Awesome place! Clean, hospital, and short walk or quick uber/lyft to all kinds of stuff. Second time I've stayed here & I'll deff do it again."
88335,13579869,407011103,2019-01-31,137447623,Chris,"Clean, affordable, respectful and peaceful.  On a busy road, but other then that, great value for shared room"
234072,33914730,498422947,2019-07-29,279259361,Jesse,It was my first time using airbnb and alejandro left with speechless and with a great first impression. I had a long day and needed a nice warm place to recharge and it was everything I wanted. I really enjoyed the small and big details and hope to stay with them next time I'm in town.
31278,4817072,37730394,2015-07-10,28161177,Chuck,"The house was great. Just as advertised. Denver was warm in July, but not to worry there was an air conditioner and it worked well.  The house was the perfect size for two and more could fit if you really wanted.

The neighborhood is great. We always felt safe and comfortable walking around. We'd consider that area to live if we were moving there. Plenty of places to eat, and a great walk into Denver.

Parking our rental car was usually easy, but you may have to walk a block at the wrong time of day or night.

The washer/dryer was a bonus. The backyard was a pleasant place to hang out. 

We'd go back"
30530,4719119,477167229,2019-06-27,267245128,Nicholas,Great place! The owner is super accommodating.
94953,14299452,321922995,2018-09-11,109036088,Gabriela,Pam's place was a great choice! We were right next to the beautiful Washington Park and in a nice quiet neighborhood. Parking is plentiful and conveniently located right outside the private entrance. Pam was generous enough to allow us to use her bikes and take a ride around the park and even into down town via the bike route. The location is about 10-15 minutes from down town Denver and a short drive away from community events like the the south pearl street farmer's market. She has a list of recommendations to do in the area including delicious restaurants. Pam's and her family were very warm and welcoming. Would stay again if we return! Thank you Pam!
119592,16946653,205001998,2017-10-20,122120332,Samuel,"Awesome place to stay. Stayed in Denver for a month for work, and Halley made it feel like home. Her home feels very welcoming, and it is a direct reflection of Halley herself. It was a stress free experience, and it felt like I was reuniting with an old friend. If you enjoy an easy-going, laid-back time then you should stay here. Halley is the best, and I will try to stay here for all my future visits to Denver. Work or leisure!"

136393,19141160,417028274,2019-02-25,33643441,Allie,"We had a great night stay at Jason’s place! Self check-in was easy and the apartment was clean and comfortable.  Plenty of space and a well provisioned kitchen were really nice to have.  Also a great residential location that was quiet at night but only two blocks from lots of restaurants, shops, etc."

I was welcomed with a small package of cookies that I brought hiking with me and a bottle a water. Very quiet home so it was perfect for when I came back after a long day, and the bed was very comfortable! Everything was very clean and the bathroom was conveniently located at the top of the stairs. Great place to stay and if I'm ever back in the area I'll definitely stay again!"
181639,23804104,539156450,2019-09-30,102435573,Spencer Reid,Walking distance to shops and train station. Had snacks and drinks already there which was a wonderful surprise! Patio was private and spacious with a coal bbq that we took advantage of. Felt like a home away from home.
108389,15802763,155797275,2017-05-28,127751531,Jon,"Marcus and his home were exceptional, with plenty of room for 6 guests. The location was fantastic, we walked to Coors Field which is only a half mile away along with plenty of great options for food. Marcus was a great host. He made sure we were comfortable before leaving, and would message us back promptly if we had any questions. I highly recommend you stay at Marcus' place if you are traveling to stay in Denver, even if it's just for one night."
4632,662431,154944147,2017-05-26,39432180,Tamenia,"The place was great! Very clean and it had everything you would need. The place being ""pet and pot"" friendly was perfect as well.

37627,6017776,182032996,2017-08-13,20085237,Benjamin,"Comfy bed, loud box spring though, so if you move a lot when you sleep that's kind of a bummer. The washer and dryer in the unit is a great inclusion. The snacks and little kitchenette were wonderful. The hostess was nice and accommodating."
133339,18811589,496659007,2019-07-27,262839573,Patrick,AMAZING hosts! Very friendly and answered any questions we had. Gave us so many tips on where to visit and what to expect. Place was very clean and nicely decorated! We will definitely be back for another visit!
23532,3810191,168607845,2017-07-09,23117867,Cameron And Kiernan,"Cathy's home was perfect, an adorable bungalow on nice, quiet residential street.  There's a front porch, a large backyard, one of the nicest airbnb kitchens i've seen- all around it's a great place to stay.  There's excellent Mexican up the street as well.  
Even more than all of this, Cathy was an exceptional host.  I had to stay an extra night in Denver unexpectedly.  I found Cathy's place and she responded immediately, and accommodated my schedule.  Thanks, Cathy!"
142990,19965849,227640400,2018-01-15,86222826,Sammi,"James place was in a great location. So close to everything in the city restaurants, bars, dispensaries. Apartment was clean and bed was amazingly comfortable. The shower had really hot water and nice pressure. We felt very comfortable here. Only negatives are the futon, it was coming apart as we set in it and we could hear our neighbors which means they could definitely hear us.  "
169657,22465754,358804377,2018-12-15,229691554,Donald,"They can expect gracious hosts, who are available to answer any questions with regards to their stay, and the Denver area."

98491,14787221,116237809,2016-11-28,66614297,Maureen,"It is a nice unit, in the heart of the Lo-Hi district. Not a well provisioned kitchen and there are not a lot of linens available. There is also no where to put away your items, so be prepared to live out of a suit case. Otherwise, the unit is comfortable (unless you have a need for more than 2 bedrooms since the 3rd is really just an office), and the area is very nice. Best for folks that have just one car, since the area around Jefferson Park has many parking restrictions (especially with Broncos games). Very close to great restaurants and shops. Easy access to I-25 and the downtown area. "
2981,142683,472878357,2019-06-20,265454198,Samantha,Nancy’s place was great and exactly as she described! Great location! Close to restaurants/cafes and city park! I got up ever morning and went for a run in the park. Everything about it was easy and convenient. I would stay there again.

If I needed to return to Denver I would definitely try and book  this again."
28520,4294257,105229568,2016-09-30,12555374,Eric,Beautiful house in a very peaceful neighborhood. Extremely comfortable stay with any amenity you could need. Highly recommended. Travis was a wonderful host. Thanks for the hospitality!

Whenever we had a question it was handled promptly. When we needed a hair dryer, one was quickly delivered. The garage is a wonderful plus in an area where on-street parking is challenging. It is very convenient to downtown Denver. You won't regret booking this unit."

1287,39405,63409115,2016-02-22,1154648,Hannah,"We had a very nice stay at the Mulberry Cottage! The hot tub was our favorite part! I'm so glad we brought our bikes, which was great for getting around downtown, but I probably wouldn't recommend walking there. It is farther than most people would probably want to walk. There's some great places in the neighborhood within walking distance to eat and drink. Very cute cottage, the pictures actually made it look a bit bigger than it actually was, but it was not a problem, nice and cozy for a weekend getaway."
29344,4504068,467605870,2019-06-10,27236991,Edward,Very clean location. Great suggestions on places to go out. I booked very last minute and they were able to accommodate. Very friendly

167814,22280793,359964408,2018-12-18,79842287,Alexandria,Kristen & Brian’s place was fantastic. So close to the city and felt like we were staying at home not in someone else’s home. It was perfect for our trip.

He is a great host and was super accommodating with changes to my plans and late arrival.

If you want a cheap and cheerful place to lay your head in Denver, Tom's is the place to be!"

33626,5347637,43490691,2015-08-20,34777048,Matthew,Greg was a fantastic host this was our first Airbnb experience and he made the time we spent in Denver very comfortable...accommodation and amenities were spotless with a very comfortable bed and fantastic lounge to relax and watch a movie... Great location with plenty of fantastic places to eat and the bus to take you down town is right on the corner of the block making getting in and back a seamless experience... Greg was very accommodating and easy to contact and willing to assist how ever he could... Would highly recommend him to anyone travelling to Denver to experience all Colorado has to offer.. 
13706,1905596,109975873,2016-10-23,65163754,Thomas,"We loved staying at Annette's flat. Its very well situated, easy to acces and a ideal base for daytrips to the lovely surrundings of Denver. We were there late oktober and the fall with all the yellow and red leaves were absolutely beautiful. 
Annette was a lovely host and very helpfull. In every way she made our vacation in Denver a good experience."

192963,25292997,334343318,2018-10-08,5985497,Matt,This place is great! Tons of space for a large group (we had 6 and it was more than enough room for everyone to spread out). The pictures don't do it justice as a historical home. Jonathan is very accommodating and helpful!
120108,17044680,401480824,2019-01-14,235557595,Dean,This house is nothing but positive vibes and close to it all!
36238,5794938,216797505,2017-12-05,160719261,Frank,"Allan’s place is an absolute gem! I booked it because of all the amazing 5-star reviews, and OMG, they weren’t kidding. First, the location: smack dab in the middle of Denver’s “Uptown” and a few steps away from 17th Avenue restaurants that blew me away…and I’m from Chicago, so that’s no easy feat! Tons of restaurants, bars, breweries, etc. in a 10 minute (or less) walk, including the Brown Palace hotel! Second, the place itself: scrupulously clean, modern, stylish and comfortable. The bed is like a magic cloud, and I slept like a log…almost missed an appointment it was so comfy! There is a long granite countertop ideal for work and morning coffee, a beautiful kitchen (with a gas stove!) and a large balcony with the impressive Denver skyline practically in touching distance. A great place to have a glass of wine and watch the sunset. Finally, Allan himself: I was only there for 2 days, but he was clearly interested in maximizing my enjoyment of his place and the city. Quick to respond, friendly and knowledgeable, in short— everything you want in a host. I give the Penthouse my absolute highest rating and hope to come back soon!"

8610,875596,4773109,2013-05-25,5960323,Sherine,"Stephanie and her home were incredible! My two girlfriends and I were doing a road trip and this was our last stop. We were greeted with a smile, a tour of her home, and the cutest welcome basket. She even allowed our friend back home to send us post cards to her home for our trip. Her house was clean and had a lovely backyard. She gave us good suggestions on what to do and made us breakfast as well as joined us on a late night walk. She is a fantastic woman and host and I would recommend staying with her to anyone!"

226620,31905174,477667840,2019-06-28,26762850,Jacqueline,"Leslie’s place was so cute and clean! Located on a darling street in a great neighborhood, with parking, we had the perfect jumping off point to explore Denver. She had a bunch of nice amenities like granola bars and waters too. And on top of that we accidentally locked ourselves out at one point and she was so quick and helpful to respond. I was blown away."
16675,2267500,64389275,2016-03-03,10721070,David,Cory's place is great for one or two people.  The neighborhood is quiet and very walkable but really handy to downtown by car.

240238,36596642,505001823,2019-08-08,12998270,Angie,"The space is pretty much exactly as described; it was ideal for me as a solo traveler with just a place to sleep and shower. There were also nice touches including decorations and a hair dryer (which I needed!) and an electric kettle. It would probably be a bit small for traveling with others, but there is outdoor space available to sit as well."
207980,27924946,524344227,2019-09-05,138827376,Kriss,"My girlfriend and I both really enjoyed the peace that Jessie’s place provided. She was very polite and quick to help us with any questions that we had. Her house is located close to a delicious restaurant, Devour the 303, and I definitely recommend their Basil Mojito! Thanks again, Jessie!"

214567,29259757,510127207,2019-08-15,94848170,Shant,"This is a spacious and light 2BR haven on the first floor in an older building (of 5 units) that has been upgraded to new and stylish comfort. Parking was easy, kitchen nice to work in, TV amenities were appreciated. Absolutely loved the neighborhood perks, like Sloan's Lake, the dine-in cinema, ice cream shop, and a few eateries within walking distance. The area seems to be ""upgrading"" currently, with plenty of residential and mixed-use construction going on ... all interesting to watch and discover. Our stay here was wonderful."
90874,13785599,239650183,2018-03-02,9484221,Lachlan,"Susan's place is just as advertised. It's very large and private. It's in a great location within walking distance of Cherry Creek and a quick Uber to downtown.  Plus, its super clean and the price is good. 

Susan is very considerate and easy to work with. I highly recommend."

155813,21177846,261551680,2018-05-06,8669657,Leah,"Stephanie's place was wonderful! Super friendly hosts and easy check in. Great location for a quick drive to downtown and nearby restaurants and sights. Bed is a futon so smaller and harder than what we are used to (the listing does disclose that, I just assumed a real bed). Also bring a sleeping mask as the space is very bright in the early morning. Other than that, this AirBNB is great! Thanks for a great trip Stephanie!"
93955,14042383,471600496,2019-06-17,255986769,Epoch,"Absolutely wonderful! Cassandra is a stellar host, in a perfect location. Train station is a quick walk, so getting there from the airport was easy. Lots of great walkable spots. Cannot recommend enough!"

213442,29023539,527355772,2019-09-10,130641092,Jacob,Brett’s Home is the definition of a 5 star AirBNB! Everything was as described and amenities were phenomenal. The best part is the location. We were able to walk to all parts of the city and got to take advantage of the location. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Denver.
117737,16742127,569820625,2019-11-27,141573301,Vickie,It was very clean and stylish!  Lots of extras.  Easy to get to and plenty of space for parking. Comfortable bed and bathroom had lots of hot water and extra clean.  It snowed and was very cold outside but the place was nice and warm.  Tammi checked on us if we needed help with our arrangements. Loved our time and will come back. Thanks!
242067,37513398,523065727,2019-09-02,287232876,Noemy,The town house was very clean and close to down town. Had reasonable parking and was a very modern house. The host was very nice and accepted us earlier than expected.. had no issues with anything.
236174,34570890,531526312,2019-09-17,198150243,Rebecca,My friend and I wanted to do a quick trip together and this was perfect. It was small but the right size and affordable for the two of us since we wanted to spend most of our time outside and exploring. Patty was very friendly and had good suggestions about what to do/where to go. We really enjoyed our time there!
225658,31621075,545132089,2019-10-11,8181841,Bibiana,The place is just like the pictures. The instructions were very clear and it was easy to check in. The hosts were very helpful all the time.

14788,2104774,448084891,2019-05-04,213405209,Robin,"This place is in a great neighborhood - so many great places to eat and drink nearby, but it’s not loud. The space is a cool, older home (like the rest of the ‘hood) with character and thoughtful, tasteful decor. A skylight brightens the living room each day. I especially loved having a unique, personal access code (that I chose and they set up) to the building and my apartment - so much easier than keys. Loved having the parking but it was only available for part of our trip. 
Remember to bring linens (bedding, towels, kitchen towels, pillows, blankets) if you don’t rent the linens from them as well as things like toilet paper and paper towels. 
There’s a 7-11 less than a block away if you need something quickly and a Sprouts and Safeway not too far away. 
Overall a great experience!"
200334,26453227,502406872,2019-08-04,53173449,Guillaume,Very calm. Not far from the center of Denver by car. Some restaurants and a supermarket in the neighborhood. The house is confortable and very well equiped.
55187,8680784,129236592,2017-01-29,109712676,Taylor,"If anybody is looking for a place to stay in Denver, Steven and Naren's place is where you should stay! The location of the apartment was superb. Only a couple minutes away form downtown and close to multiple eating and drinking venues. We also parked right in front of the building for free so coming and going was a breeze. My fiancé and I loved our stay and will be hitting up Steven and Naren's place for our next trip to Denver."

4010,548897,30801784,2015-04-27,1771461,Carolyn,"This is a fantastic little apartment in a cool, interesting part of Denver. The apartment itself has everything that you could need: privacy, a comfortable bed, dresser and shower. It is just blocks away from great restaurants (I particularly recommend Pinche Taquería, Vine Brewery and Max's Greek Diner). It is also in walkable distance to the Botanic Gardens which is a must see. Heather was a great host, we didn't meet her personally but she was instantly responsive when I had questions about the wi-fi (we fixed it) and the parking space located on property. Thanks for a great experience Heather!"
30870,4753876,417288131,2019-02-26,55135458,Connor,Great place with all of the essentials! Perfect location within walking distance to all downtown locations on our agenda. The rooftop is awesome as well. Would recommend to a friend and return again.
218214,29802468,565688497,2019-11-17,233503014,Crystal,What you see is what you get! This home looks exactly like the photos. Very spacious and clean. Located in a very nice and quiet neighborhood. They have EVERYTHING you will need. Jim and Michelle are also quick to respond to any concerns or questions. The location is close to the airport and about 20-25 mins to downtown. There is a bus stop close close by to take you to the rails to get to Union Station. I would recommend a car rental though if you’ll be out and about a lot. Overall I “highly” recommend this place!!
182075,23880394,418235379,2019-03-01,108742829,Duane,great place.
229326,32534303,491139999,2019-07-19,158857065,Melina,"Ayman’s place was tidy and clean. The bathroom was also very clean. Kitchen didn’t have many utensils but we stayed out all day long so didn’t really need to prepare any food. The room was spacious with a small wardrobe and a desk too. Only thing that made our stay a tiny little bit difficult was the fact that Ayman is really sensitive when I’m comes to noises at night, so even using the bathroom at night was a bit of a challenge. All in all we had a really pleasant stay and would recommend for people with a car since there is not much to see or do in the area."

153186,21029294,407597518,2019-02-02,94106679,Rich,"Dave’s townhouse is in a fantastic location- LoHi is a great neighborhood and downtown Denver is very close by. I walked, rode Lime Ebikes and Ubered to get everywhere I wanted to go.

The room itself is cozy with a comfortable queen bed and the upstairs living space is very modern and classy. Dave is a great host. I’d definitely stay here again!"
231282,33223515,474071419,2019-06-22,110158727,Melissa,Great location and loved having a coffee shop and food right on site. Easy to get around and the parking is a bonus!

Used the ice chest in closet one day which was convenient. Had issue with noise one night and host was right on it. Careful if your tall with low basement ceiling. Would recommend.

The art work and decor is in her home is wonderful and it is local art. Her place is very cozy and has everything  you need from coffee pods, to laundry soap, Net Flix, the softest blankets and so much more. The mattress in the bedroom is heavenly.  I stayed with my daughter, her husband and 18 -month-old. They got the bed and I slept on the sofa pull out. I would highly recommend Lynn’s place. The South Pearl area  is amazing. And Lynn answered promptly with any question I had."

Highly recommend it!"
8354,866145,80091792,2016-06-16,77754343,Brian,"This was my first Airbnb reservation.   Preston was very good to keep in contact with me, which was very helpful.   The property is top-notch, and I felt as though they made a lot of space for their guests.   The neighborhood is very convenient to everything I enjoy in Denver.  They weren't there at check in, but had everything laid out, and the lights on to welcome me.  A little note by the bed, assured my welcome, and let me know that I could ask them if I needed anything.    
After an evening out in the city, I arrived home to meet Jan, who was whipping up a batch of banana bread for our breakfast the next morning.   We chatted about his world travels and that he worked in a big hotel in Scotland for a time.   I guess that explains how these guys have a really good concept of being great hosts.   
Thanks for the room, Predton and Jan.  I will definitely want to stay there again.  "

142660,19909192,276105003,2018-06-12,27586576,Alex,"Had a great stay at Jorge’s place in Cap Hill. The apartment itself was clean and in good shape - bright, spacious, airy - check-in was easy, and Jorge was prompt and responsive with communication. The immediate neighborhood was a little dodgy but the location is central and overall I feel like I got a great deal staying here."
151912,20995111,353815755,2018-11-29,21825385,Thomas,"Great place. Nice location super clean and modern place. I was woken up by very loud construction and people walking on the roof before the sun rise. Once The construction is over it will be a great place but until then it’s extremely hard to sleep in the morning and there is quiet time rules from 10 PM to 8 AM that my guest and I respected, but the construction workers that started at 6 or 7 AM did not respect the quiet hours at all. Otherwise it’s an awesome place, one of the nicer Airbnb’s for the price for sure!"
91030,13789731,226451583,2018-01-10,26375334,Jenny,Exactly as pictured... except seems much bigger! Perfect location- We will definitely stay here again
238171,35464927,512694472,2019-08-18,9328214,Alex,"This place has a great back patio for lounging, very well decorated, comfortable beds and a super short walk to Washington Park, which was lovely for a morning walk. My only con would be the noise level. If the owner is home, you can hear every single step they take on the 2nd floor (rental is on the 1st/ basement).  I would stay again, but would highly recommend ear plugs to help sleep through it if you’re a light sleeper"

182992,24015212,366977219,2019-01-03,3426740,Julie,"Sandy’s house is so much more than a place to stay. It was as comfortable as your own home. From the kitchen, with anything you need, to the adorable bedrooms, huge master,  to the comfortable living room and cute front porch and backyard, the entire stay was awesome! It was decorated for Christmas which was such a wonderful touch since we arrived the day after! Sandy checked in often, had goodies to partake of on our arrival and it felt like home! Since we were there for our daughter’s wedding, the house was big enough to house the whole family! We had several wonderful evenings together and there were even games to use! I’d totally recommend this home."

The house was adorable and was the perfect size for my weekend trip to Denver with my best friend. If you don't mind walking, there are some great bars/restaurants within a mile of the house which were all fabulous. It was a short and cheap uber ride to downtown which was so convenient. I would absolutely stay here again the next time I am in Denver. Emily - thank you for everything!! I love your house!!! "

20885,3425074,502363981,2019-08-04,266631244,Jason,"The place was great, what it says to be in the description. The only reason I am giving a 4 star review is because the wifi was extremely slow in my room. Could not get an HD video stream at all, and SD was lagging too. I could not download a podcast on spotify either, so yeah pretty slow. I valued that a bit I guess, but other than that, the place was great all around, not far from downtown."

The grocery store was right at the corner and it was walking distance to many bars and restaurants. Maya was a great host and even had cookies and fresh flowers for us when we arrived.
177568,23378643,532378267,2019-09-19,188019599,Michael,Awesome possum pad. Would first off state that this is not necessarily a place for someone that is in Denver for business. But if you are here to have fun then this is the place to be. The outside appearance does not reflect the true awesomeness of the inside. Great interior architecture and design such as the checkered subway tile in the bathroom are the little touches that make this place really cool. Large master bedroom and another bedroom with an adjoining balcony. I personally had a small issue when checking in but James was right on top of it. Would stay again!

38003,6141491,99675410,2016-09-05,73448250,Marie,"Brian's house was clean and comfortable with two bedrooms which had an en suite bath and one bath off the main hall for all others to share. He was friendly and communicative throughout the stay and would not hesitate to stay here again. The neighborhood really can't be beat! One thing to be aware of if you are staying in the summer, the thermostat is not adjustable so if sleeping at a temp of 66 is not comfortable, be prepared to crack the windows or bring extra layers."

It was in a great location close to downtown and we discovered a cool seafood spot called The Crawling Cab nearby and a fantastic breakfast/brunch place called Syrup. Both were AMAZING and only 6 bucks away with the Lyft discount. 

It was also the cleanest place I have ever stayed outside of my own (and my mother in laws) home!

Communication was awesome and I felt like well taken care of. 

The mountain views from the third floor were so beautiful and unexpected. 

Thanks for letting us have our little retreat in your space!"

17102,2361919,140953083,2017-04-01,101786694,Kelsey,The studio was just what I needed. My three month stay was great. There are lots of dogs on the property so it's important that you are comfortable with that but they are all very friendly.

Parking was easy and free on the street and there are lots of nice cafes, shops and bars within walking distance.

Would definitely book again if I could."

Loved the easy access (no keys to lose) in and out of the building. I would highly recommend this apartment. Thanks!!"
181045,23746299,404578392,2019-01-24,49575493,Tom,We had a nice time at Jim’s.  It was in a good location and Jim has excellent communication.

Be aware that if you don’t check in early, you may be stuck with an open top bunk on a shaky bed frame that’s only a privacy curtain away from the kitchen/living room where people may have lights on or be eating/working etc. if you like to sleep early"

191624,25076034,531966016,2019-09-18,245159378,Michelle,"The apartment was beautiful, hated to leave it! Neighbors were friendly, the outside courtyard was awesome. Sat out there a couple of evenings and also visited The Lobby downstairs, mega great; the whole package you want to call home!
Can’t say enough about the stay. Warning, stairs, 3 flights up to the condo. It’s worth the location and place. It was the best for our first trip to Colorado. Would stay there again if we returned."
123572,17388640,181963228,2017-08-13,8472696,Caroline,"Eric's place was great, a short ride to downtown but also a 5-10 min walk to some great bars and restaurants in a nice neighborhood. The house was very clean and well equipped with Apple TV, Alexa, and a nice personal bar. Eric was extremely helpful and accommodating - highly recommend a stay here!"

The basement has the coziest couch that was hard to leave!  The location is absolutely perfect. There are so many great places to eat and visit within walking distance. We would love to come back!"
43536,7091323,87315662,2016-07-19,80013048,Ryan,"In our second consecutive stay with Joseph, arriving at the house and receiving the keys was easier than ever. Here's my review from both stays overall: 
""Joseph and his friendly dog Polar Bear met us immediately upon arrival to show us our room and arrangements. During our stay, he was unobtrusive but available for questions whenever we needed. The house is in a quiet neighborhood outside of Denver but right next to a bus stop, making it easy to get into the city on public transit. Joseph is continually updating his house. He had just installed new interior doors and was in the process of fixing the sink while we were there. This listing is only getting better!"""
60771,9250245,417011334,2019-02-25,32583834,Anna,Great place to stay and check out the downtown area. Everything is walking distance and there are bike/scooter rentals everywhere. There was a surplus of homeless people but I was never approached by any and never felt unsafe. Also be ready to climb multiple flights of stairs! They definitely kept us breathing hard. We’ll be back! Thanks Rob!
60025,9169634,160342373,2017-06-13,131467711,Patrick,"This was a great place to stay for our trip.  If you know what you're getting into (a no-frills basement apartment with one large bed and one small bed) you won't be disappointed.  This served as an excellent home base for us.  If you stay here, definitely get the calzone at Gennaro's nearby.  Good breakfast at Morning Collective and Breakfast on Broadway.  Safe, quiet neighborhood.  Felt comfortable walking at day or night.  There's an RTD bus stop right out front and an RTD train station in walking distance which made cheaply getting around accessible.    "
31553,4862881,138425582,2017-03-19,16695820,Juliette,Everything was perfect!

I loved the coffee and snacks provided in the room and the house was in a great location and quiet neighborhood. Would recommend this place to others if passing through the area!

21866,3495498,84905582,2016-07-09,29695943,Colleen,"Mallory's place is the PERFECT home base for a Denver adventure.  I stayed 4 nights with my husband and dog, hiking & seeing the mountains in the morning and visiting breweries/restaurants/Denver-specific retail stores (you get the idea...)  in the afternoon and eveningThe space is exactly as represented in the photos - everything was incredibly clean and modern.  The home was stocked with pretty much anything you could think you'd need and then some.  The fenced-in backyard and fire pit made for awesome evenings watching our dog run around and enjoying some local flavors.  The Giving Tree dispensary is literally a 5-minute walk around the corner, and The Universal restaurant for brunch (also right around the corner) is not to be missed!  We only used one bedroom but the bed & bedding were so comfortable too!  The location in the Highlands was awesome - you're a quick Uber from just about anywhere you want to go in the city, and so close to the highway that getting out to the mountains for some hiking is very convenient (we did this all 3 days - happy to share our agenda if anyone wants!).  Note that the garage is small, as advertised - we traveled with a Toyota Rav4 and it just fit, so anything larger than that won't make the cut.  Overall, this made for an amazing home base for us to relax in after long days of hiking and brewery visiting.  If you're looking for things to do, Mallory provides a binder with all kinds of local attractions and her favorite spots - definitely worth checking out!  Hopefully will have the chance to return and stay again!"

The loft was so cute, looked brand new when we got there it was perfectly clean. They thought of everything and took advantage of the space so well. We felt very at home! We also loved the location, it's just close enough to downtown and walking distance to some places.
Would definitely recommend!"

32873,5070640,65775345,2016-03-17,26874011,Betsy,"Andrea was very friendly on the phone and fully answered all our questions.  We arrived to a very cozy space, but perfectly nice for a couple.  There was a huge bowl of fruit to greet us and everything was very clean and orderly.  The ""carriage house"" in back was in a great location if you want a quiet, tree-lined residential area but within a close walk of a ""hip"" street with great restaurants and shops."

It was clean, in a great location and Ryan also had coffee in the unit that we could make for ourselves in the morning. This place was great- didn't feel like a basement at all!  I would definitely stay here again!"

Hector and Teena met us at the door to give us the keys and explained everything in detail. They were both very nice and quick to respond. I would definitely recommend staying here."

93753,14027297,133112379,2017-02-20,1099527,Sarah,"First of all, Caroline’s place is AMAZING and I plan to recommend it to anyone staying in Denver. I did a long term stay but it would also be great for a short term stay. Great value for the place and if you want to stay in Denver and feel like you live there, this is the place. I was there for 2 months, so I have a lot to share!

Home: I am going to miss this little row house. It was so clean when we arrived and Caroline made it perfect for guests. She left a ton of space in the for your stuff in the closets, drawers, bathroom, etc. I felt like I could be right at home. The kitchen is really large for the size of the place and I enjoyed cooking in it. There is a TV in the living room (past reviews say there is no TV) and an HDMI cable, but no cable. So bring your own stuff! Caroline allowed us to bring our two dogs and backyard is just perfect. She even has a bike you can use and two chairs for nice weather. The bed is comfortable and there are a ton of sheets, towels, blankets, and pillows. The couch in the living room opens up to a bed that I was able to use for guests and there are enough comforters and sheets for 4 people comfortably. 

Location: I love Whittier and Five Points! The house is super close to the train (literally next door) and a few blocks to the Five Point area which has a ton of coffee shops, food, and bars. We just fell in love with the area. We walked our dogs a couple times a day and always felt safe. It is close to the I-70 and very close to downtown. At one point we had two cars and a moving truck and we could always park right on the street. 

Host: Caroline has by far been the most responsive and respectful host I have ever dealt with. She really cares to make the stay wonderful. 

Thank you, Caroline! I am sad to leave."

Valerie is super nice and helpful with things to do and places to see in and around the Denver area, she even recommended places for yoga and barre classes close by and when she saw me heading to the Rocky Mountains with only a light jacket on she let me borrow her own personal jacket and gloves for the hike. I loved staying here and it was definitely a  home away from home and I plan on coming back in March and staying again. Thank you so much for the hospitality. :)"

He is a smart and cute cat we had some great time together. Juliet prepared a lot of amenities for us. We didn't need to buy any extra things while we stayed there. She is very prompt to response our questions even if she was overseas. Our communication was great and I really appreciate that she gave us couple neighbor and friends contact information in case we needed any help. The price was reasonable for the entire house. The back yard is big and cozy. Overall it is a great experience.

She also left a list of places to go, and any other information I needed so that we can have a great stay.  Everyone said that the house was amazing and was surprised to find out there was a basement where, there was a game room, which we spent most of our time there.  The place was lovely and getting to places wasn't bad either.  Overall, if I ever come back to Colorado for vacation, or anyone else, I highly recommend staying here.  I was very cozy and perfect for the amount of people we had.  We hope to come back soon!!

My friends and I were very impressed, and hey loved how close it was to a certain boba shop - I may have turned them into bubble tea fiends over the weeekend. Really close by to some great places to eat and grocery stores in case you want to run out and grab a snack. They also managed to squeeze me in for an early check-in, which was wonderful since I actually flew in at 10am. 

Angela was also helpful with food recommendations, and her responses to my messages were extremely quick. I’d definitely recommend the house to anyone staying in the area."

115436,16438823,155676466,2017-05-28,104035527,Jackson,"It was gigantic!  Much bigger than we expected.  Very easy to get to 16th street, and the beds were extremely comfortable.

Thank you!!"

18047,2723629,368946163,2019-01-08,209087063,Kalli,"The House on Stout is beautiful, homey, and bright in all of the best ways. There were lots of cozy places to read, everything you could need in the kitchen, and RiNo, LoDo, and other neighborhoods were all just a short Lyft away. Thank you for a great stay!"
141348,19786959,233470675,2018-02-09,162954651,Haroon,"Great location, updated and clean unit. Has all the amenities you need. Major downsides included: noise from upstairs as well as pipes made it difficult to sleep, and parking took 30-45 mins to find a space."
228351,32308061,521291315,2019-08-31,159522924,Keith,"Jerry's place was super clean, quiet and comfortable, just like the pic's. he checked in with us to see if we needed anything, work out nicely for us."
158340,21380975,230949676,2018-01-29,129661533,Tommy,"Brand new, super clean!! Great place to relax and unwind! The Roof has a beautiful view of Downtown and the Mountains. Conveniently located roughly two minutes from the Interstate, and about 5 from Downtown it makes it easy to get around! Will definitely be giving Brody a call next trip to Denver!"
204914,27419666,509599818,2019-08-14,256727188,Smadar,"the space was great for my teenage son and I, with visitors. We loved the little extra touches, like blankets and games and bikes. The garden was fabulous. The downstairs lack of natural light got a little dark. John was super quick and kind in all communication. I felt like he was there with any question and super helpful. The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet and relaxing. Views of the sky and luscious garden were extra delightful. A lovely visit and highly recommended."

101315,15054823,314337059,2018-08-26,199974125,Grace,"The apartment was perfect for our short stay in Glendale. It was only a few minutes from Glendale Infinity Park where my husband rugby tournament was. 
There was always plenty of parking and it was adjacent to a nice little park with beautiful green grass. 
We would love to come and stay again next year for Rugby Town USA! "
57878,8954951,240712842,2018-03-05,45581692,Wilson,"We really enjoyed our stay at Ena's townhouse - it was clean, spacious, and convenient. It was an easy walk to coffee shops and breweries. Definitely recommend for a bigger group or if you're looking to stay in the RiNo area."
60313,9201317,153093568,2017-05-19,101828151,Laura,It is a basement room but very nicely done and quiet. Much nicer than the Marriott with highway noise I stayed the previous night. 
55075,8680784,54331105,2015-11-18,19235154,Meg,"Steven was very welcoming and friendly, easy to communicate with before the rental. The apartment was spotless and well decorated, located in a charming old building close to downtown. Would absolutely rent here again! "
37604,6017776,162196715,2017-06-19,10441834,Renee,"We were in and out of McKenna's place, and spent a total of about 9 hours there, of which 7 of them were sleeping. But we had everything we needed and it was only 20 minutes to/from the airport. Also, loved the decor - lots of plants, great natural light, and very comfortable bed. All the necessities!"
210837,28464192,508378437,2019-08-12,33474336,Sabrina,"I felt extremely disrespected by the host, Jacquelyn. My guest and I both suffered from allergies due to the combination of dust and pet dander permeating this property. We felt the allergies immediately after sitting on the couch for a few minutes the first night. We had to take Benadryl and stay at a hotel for the night.  

We wanted to work towards a resolution together, but Jacquelyn’s immediate response was claiming that our group was loud and kept her up all night, questioning our allergies, and insinuating that we had never left that night to go to the hotel. It was incredibly unprofessional and inconsiderate. She never told us we were keeping her awake that night, and the noise that kept her up was most likely from my guest and I coughing, wheezing, and packing our belongings to head to the hotel.

Instead of being understanding and accommodating, Jacquelyn snapped at us and also said we should have known there were dogs in the house based on her previous Airbnb profile picture with her dog (how can you expect us to come to that conclusion based on an old photo?), and that this was hidden at the end of the “house rules” section only. We honestly did not expect our allergies to be that bad, also considering this is advertised as a “private apartment”. Yes, we understand it is the guests’ responsibility to review the full description but we never expected to be treated with such disrespect and to be so belittled by a host. 

If you are sensitive to pet dander and dust, please keep that in mind before booking this property and read through the lengthy description fully. You can also hear every movement that comes from the upper level. As a guest, I would have never expected to be treated so poorly by the host. Not hospitable at all. It really put a damper on what was supposed to be a fun and relaxing trip. Check out all the other great listings in Denver instead. I’m sure the other hosts will treat you with more kindness."
119479,16925673,275344034,2018-06-10,60498591,Shelby,"Very clean, stylish and easy to get to. Parking was super easy and LaMark was very kind and hospitable. "
88313,13579869,271198164,2018-05-31,79936372,Joshua,Great for the price
220182,30342326,479924760,2019-07-01,118095167,Brian,"This house has a precious courtyard that we absolutely enjoyed. The homeowner has strung lights to make it the perfect setting for relaxing outside at night. We loved the way the house was decorated and setup. The pictures for the house make it seem more “upscale” than it is. It’s more like a downtown loft style home- with exposed wood, etc. However, it’s a beautiful home with fun touches, in a quiet neighborhood. Unlike most places we’ve stayed, there was no typical welcome kit or instructions about cleanup when we left. We would absolutely stay here again."
59113,9108143,216782927,2017-12-05,346579,Peter,Great location and home. Highly recommend and would stay here again if I ever come back to Denver.

73478,11555808,103028289,2016-09-20,79255306,Covenant,"Thomas was a very hospitable host and made me feel very welcomed. The listing is accurate in that this is merely a room with a bed. There are other rooms in the basement he rents out, and you share a bathroom with these individuals. However, I didn't really have an issue when it came to needing the facilities. The lack of A/C did not bother me as the weather was mild, and Thomas had provided a large fan. The fan was also great for white noise. I'm a light sleeper and the fan helped with the noise of people coming up and down the stairs to the basement. Another area that people may want to know is that half of the door to this particular room is opaque glass. You can't see in or out, but light from the basement does come in when the lights are on (as I said, I'm a light sleeper)."
205088,27432059,503811163,2019-08-06,67378007,Gage,Doesn’t get better. Perfect place right in the arts district.
32458,4964614,173725170,2017-07-23,47718195,Jake,"Linda's place is great. She's very communicative to make sure you get settled and great at making suggestions on the Cap hill area. Make sure to go for a run around Cheeseman Park, grab breakfast at Jelly Cafe and walk over to City O'City for some drinks and a late night breakfast sandwich (best thing I ate in Denver!!!)"
56055,8721578,494637100,2019-07-24,187425831,Xuebing,Everything was made nice and easy staying at Stephanie’s place.

118537,16857174,361053721,2018-12-22,90343272,Zach,"Rodney’s place was perfect- for the price, you’re not going to find a more stylish, centrally located, engaged host. The place is three stories, bottom one for storing stuff, second kitchen and living room, and third has the bedrooms. Communication was incredibly thorough and proactive, full of local tips. I flew into Denver, took the train to Union Station (~35mins, $9) and then walked for probably a little over a mile. So many good places to eat and cafes in the RiNo area- lucked out finding this place, would highly recommend."
36593,5956309,89882611,2016-07-30,54225976,Slaton,Alex was a fantastic host. Very easy going and truly made me feel as if his house was my own.

8956,915016,61150583,2016-02-01,19121168,Stephanie," We had a great time staying in Tim and Cindy's basement apartment. It was centrally located as described in the listing and it was very easy to get around (close to downtown and other attractions). There are grocery stores, restaurants, coffees shops walking distance from the house. The place was very clean and had all the essentials that we needed (kitchen appliances, towels, cleaning supplies, etc.). Parking was a bit tough at night. The street parking fills up so we had to drive around for a while to find a spot. Not a big deal, just something to consider when staying in this area. The other thing to keep in mind is that because this is a basement apartment, you do hear footsteps and voices from upstairs. Overall we had a great time and enjoyed staying here. "
69127,10747925,284466673,2018-07-01,27810938,Sam,"Billy's place was the perfect spot for our stay. The neighborhood is quiet but close enough to walk to restaurants, bars, and downtown. The space itself was spacious, clean, and comfortable, and the hot tub and patio were added bonuses. We also had two cars, and had no problem finding a second parking spot on the street right in front of the house. Thanks for a great stay!"
163689,21818112,539061788,2019-09-30,296242694,Aaliyah,She was very nice and replied fast with any questions we had. The house was super close to downtown in a good neighborhood. We loved sitting outside next to the fire pit and the house was perfect for  having dogs. The house was spacious and clean. Exceeded our expectations. It was a great find and would definitely recommend!
99221,14836832,141768594,2017-04-04,118987898,Nathalie,"Great central location to shopping and restaurants, one king, one small queen, one bathroom with kitchen. TV only in the living room with no premium channels. Nice kitchen if you choose to use it. Nice furnishings and nice view. Host was very accommodating for late check in. Parking spot included. "

Would also be great with kids, but we were a group of old high school buddies getting together for our annual trip and it was perfect for us.  Do yourself a favor and book your Denver stay here!"

Will stay in there in my next visit to Denver!"
191220,25055975,336839071,2018-10-14,81161949,Jeremy & DaNae,"Our stay at Grady’s was amazing. The place is beautiful, brand new, and has plenty of room for a large group. It’s also centrally located so getting around the city is really easy. Grady even helped send an item that we left behind. Overall, we couldn’t have asked for a better visit."
149072,20761981,201587371,2017-10-08,69125556,Courtney,Great location with plenty to do and see. The hosts were so friendly and welcoming. Come just so you can meet them.

The neighborhood is great with Santa Fe Ave and Broadway near by. Cherry creek is nearby which gives direct access to Denver via scooter! Otherwise about a 10 min car ride and you're in the heart of Downtown Denver. Julian was awesome and even showed us around Denver on our last day, which made the stay memorable. Def will stay again next time I'm in Denver!"

When we arrived Billy and his wife gave us a warm welcome and a thorough house tour. His house was super clean, tidy and neat, the location is great (I love Stapleton!), and I loveee the rooftop balcony ❤️. We are not done with Denver yet, will come back and stay at Billy's again for sure."
242533,37776588,522223912,2019-09-01,115716185,Victoria,"Joe was a great host, friendly and welcoming.  The location was convenient to a few good neighborhood restaurants, bars and ice cream parlor.  I would recommend staying there if you are looking for a local neighborhood vibe."
46274,7562368,200484948,2017-10-05,133534054,Michael,My wife and I stayed at Ryan and Mel's recently for our honeymoon.  We could not have been happier with this place.  It was as listed and even nicer in person.  Communication with the hosts was great as they were very responsive.  Check in was a breeze.  They even have a book of local places to go (which was very helpful) and instructions for anything and everything in the house.  It was a very cozy place and we had no problem being able to unwind after a day of adventures.  The location is close to many restaurants in a vibrant part of town.  We would definitely stay there again.  5 starts all the way

173776,22978126,274653664,2018-06-09,23701134,Sylvia,"We had a very nice stay at Anne's studio. Everything was as expected and it was close to freeways to get into the mountains. The host recommendations for food were fantastic, and a lot of the good places for breakfast and dinner were within walking distance! We didn't bring our dog but she would have enjoyed the location as well with its proximity to a dog park. The one thing I would recommend to renters is to check an online crime map before wandering around (particularly in the evenings), as some of the streets can change from trendy to sketchy depending on which block you're on. All in all we had a great time."
117248,16733876,281849004,2018-06-25,55983888,Nicolette,"We loved our stay at Carissa’s place. It’s conveniently located near lots of things to do in the city, but you still get to come back to a quiet space (with plenty of parking, definitely a plus)."

It is in the perfect area for great access to all the best restaurants, shopping, art, and night life. The home itself is cozy and comfortable and adorable. Even though it is small on square footage, the layout makes it feel much more spacious and very open. The perfect landing pad for a fun trip to Denver. Will definitely be coming back to Jason St! "

Our flight didn’t arrive until 11pm and didn’t arrive until about midnight ( paid for the day before  obviously) and he wasn’t sure how we would obtain the key bc we weren’t there before 10 which seems interesting as I have never had a host care when I arrived as long as I had paid for that day of course. However, he figured it out after a few texts. As we were checking out, I asked if we could keep our luggage in the room for a few hours after checking out until our plane arrived and he responded to me “ ask the front desk” so that wasn’t the response I am used to. When being an air bnb host i think you should never make your guest feel like a Nuisance for when they arrive in town. Overall a great place to stay but I think Aaron May be new to air bnb So he can catch on to the hospitality rules."

We were happy to find coffee and snacks waiting for us when we arrived. The claw foot tub is really cool.  It was easy to make breakfast in the kitchen.  The host was responsive and helpful.

The location is perfect, close to downtown, to some very nice restaurants and the neighborhood is safe and quiet. Everything in the house was spotless, nicely decorated and Nick’s advices help a lot. The two bikes (helmet included) were a great way to visit Denver, and the garden a nice place to relax and have dinner. I highly recommend Nick!"
28573,4294257,173712607,2017-07-23,50580988,Lisa,We stayed at Travis's apartment for a weekend in July. It was perfect for us while visiting our son who lives within walking distance. We did not have a car and either walked or used lyft to get around. We were very busy with a breakfast picnic at the Botanic Gardens  and then another lunch picnic with grilled hamburgers in City Park with our son and his roommate for college whose parents happened to be in town. It was wonderful to come back to Travis's to rest or jump in the shower before our next adventure. We slept great in the comfy bed and I did not hear any neighbors or street noise at all. We love staying in an Airbnb or (Hidden by Airbnb) when we visit our son because we can spread out and relax.

While we kept to ourselves and didn’t need anything during our stay, it was nice to know he was close by if needed.   Perfect walking distance for us to downtown and easy to grab a scooter for a quick ride. Lyft was 8-9.00 to get to union station. Would recommend!"

Right next to a beautiful park and quick walk to Whole Foods and local coffee shops for your everyday needs. Easily walkable to everything you want to see in Denver plus Zipcar and scooters nearby to get a little further. You are right on a train line and it can get a bit loud at night, but there are ear plugs and a noise machine provided. All in all a great spot!"
82564,13059132,267741261,2018-05-22,169162666,Anne,This is a great neighborhood. Several great resturants within blocks. We walked everywhere.

The place was exactly as described and in a great area for our visit to Denver, fun shops and a farmers market just blocks away.
We are hoping on our next visit to come stay again!"
242392,37707661,566147814,2019-11-18,8693284,Jethro,"Kate and Derek are outstanding hosts and were very welcoming. The apartment is terrific and perfect for a father son weekend. Plenty of space and a nice kitchen. Street parking was easy and right in front of the house. Easy access to downtown Denver. 

Try Blue Pan Pizza, less than a mile from the house. 

Highly recommended."

The AirBnB was in a good location, close to downtown Denver and a vibrant shopping and restaurant area just around the corner just a short walk down the street."
213931,29128667,430005554,2019-03-29,244724581,Russell,"Victorien was a great host. You are given a large bedroom with a private bath. If you are on an extended stay, you can cook and do laundry. Shopping for food is right around the corner.  The neighborhood is safe and quiet, and you are given a doorcode to enter the house when you arrive. The airport is about 20 minutes away, and a Lyft ride runs about 15 dollars.  If you are training at the SSS, it is a 5 minute car ride (1 mile)."

The kitchen was stocked with lights snacks and drinks which was greatly appreciated on busy days. They were extremely accommodating for our little 7 month old we brought along. They do have two cute children and you can hear quite of bit of noise starting in the morning. We were gone most of the day so we didn't really mind.  We would happily stay here again! "

Rebecca and Charlie helped me all the time when I need something. They are open to communicate and very friendly. I would definetely choose the same place again for next denver visit.

Thanks for all :)"
139218,19503543,332187375,2018-10-04,33212468,Mark,Parking absolutely sucks. Be prepared to walk after you park. You may get lucky with parking outside but honestly don’t expect anything. Also if you sleep in the bedroom with the sliding door. Be prepared to have a light on all night in your bedroom. The security light outside goes on and off every 2 min. If you’re expecting a Hot tub. It’s definitely a tub but I wouldn’t call it a “HOT” Tub!
23527,3810191,96822959,2016-08-24,42162153,Joni,"Cathy was wonderful! She checked on us after arrival to ensure we had what we needed. The house is gorgeous and SPOTLESS. The decor matches the personality of the house beautifully. Bright pops of color with warm neutrals between. The kitchen setup is a little strange, but that's the older home charm. The garden and backyard are well kept, but not stuffy - definitely a homey touch. The bed and sitting areas were comfortable and roomy. Street parking isn't for everyone, but I never had trouble finding a spot. Favorite part of the property is the built-ins. They are perfect for the personality and style of the house! "
115384,16413329,238452163,2018-02-25,16512096,Joshua,"This home was perfectly positioned to take advantage of all that Denver has to offer. It is walking distance to Little Man Ice Cream, Linger, El Five, and pretty much any of the other food hotspots in the LoHi area. It was only a few blocks from Zuni Street Brewery, and there are a ton of great bars nearby as well. We even took the pedestrian bridge over into downtown to check out Denver Beer Company. The walkability of this space is really what won us over, and we would definitely stay here again if we're ever back in Denver. The space was well-appointed, and you can tell Kev and Jessa really do fit the architect/designer description in their profile, and there were nice personal touches throughout the home. Our friends (who were staying in an Airbnb a few blocks away) were blown away when they saw it. The vibe was mid-century modern with a warm, inviting living area that had a comfortable couch and a TV. We are 100% streamers at home, but we didn't test out any of the included streaming services. We tried the cable TV just to veg out one night, but it was hard to find a channel they were subscribed to (we couldn't watch NBC Sports or USA, so we settled on ION). This really isn't important in this day and age but it was a minor frustration at the time (especially during Olympics season). That being said, the internet is super fast; I tested 300 Mbps down/10 Mbps up, which was quite impressive. The Alexa was a nice touch as well, as we are used to using her at home to check the weather and to look up random things. The home was well-insulated and it was easy to maintain a comfortable temperature. The kitchen was spacious and there was a variety of condiments and other accoutrements in the fridge, though we ate out during our stay. There was a bar with a variety of interesting spirits as well, which was a nice touch even though we didn't take advantage of them. For breakfast, it's just a 1.5 block walk down to ProsperOats, which we stopped by each morning for coffee and occasionally a breakfast bowl. I'd definitely recommend checking it out. The bathroom was well-appointed, the towels were very soft, and we had a large towel, hand towel, and washcloth for each of us. Make sure to read the description carefully and search for the correct number of guests as there is an extra charge for every person more than the first (so the linens are metered out appropriately). The bed was incredibly comfortable. It was a king-sized Casper with an additional pillowtop mattress protector/topper. There were two pillows, one quite soft and the other medium-to-firm. I didn't look very hard because I felt bad looking through their closets, but I would have liked an additional pillow or two, as the soft one was way too flat for me. Luckily, it worked..."
198086,26162550,412499078,2019-02-15,233379523,Peter,Lovely place. A+ location. Thaddeus was a great host.

33117,5070640,520601356,2019-08-30,135860766,Philip,This detached home is in a great location at a great price and off street parking. I highly recommend it! Many nice touches such as coffee and fresh fruits.
218040,29762898,503903473,2019-08-06,6592058,Neraj,"Overall had a good stay here. The main complaint I have is that the entrance to the unit was through the garage, and the trash cans were right next to the door. So when we opened the door flies would come in. We got around that by opening and closing the door quickly. There were also a few spiders and insects, I'm guessing because it's a ""basement"" unit.

Be aware of the fact that there is no kitchen and only one window (in the bathroom). Also note that you can definitely hear footsteps from upstairs so if you are a light sleeper this is probably not a good option for you.

Lastly I was a little bit surprised that they expected us to put the towels and sheets in the washer when we were leaving. I've never had to do that before at any airbnb I've stayed at, and I've definitely stayed at my fair share of airbnb's. Not a big deal, it took no more than 10 minutes, but the cleaning fee I paid should incorporate this task."
193869,25455417,421094213,2019-03-08,237686967,Julianna,"David's Carriage House was perfect for my boyfriend and me during our first trip to Denver! It was rather small, as stated, but with just two of us, it was all the space we needed. The decor was very modern and the overall look/feel of the house was stylish. The location of the carriage house is something that we were very happy with. It was 10 minutes from downtown and a nice scenic drive up to the mountains. Although it is tucked away in an alley, David does a great job of explaining how to actually get to the house in the listing, so that was helpful when using Über. 

The only faults I would give the house is the temperature of the shower and how hard it was to warm up the downstairs. The shower didn't get as hot as we would have liked, so our showers were pretty quick. For some reason, the downstairs was harder to keep warm than the upstairs. 

Overall, our stay was great! If anyone is looking for a smaller, affordable place with a good location and great host, this is the spot!! Thanks, David!"

132714,18775585,263003093,2018-05-10,3085286,Anna,"This place was even better than pictured - very thoughtfully planned out and feels much larger than its square footage would suggest.   Great design, comfortable beds, and safe neighborhood.  Communication was incredibly easy - I'd get a reply to questions/requests typically within minutes and the hosts were very accommodating.  They really strove to make the experience a great one - even warned us to move our rental car ahead of the scheduled street cleaning so that we wouldn't get towed!  We traveled with our infant and the place was really easily with the kiddo - they provided a pack n play complete with a clean set of sheets and we really appreciated that there was a baby gate at the top of the stairs!  Overall, I highly recommend staying here and would not hesitate to book here again!"
44401,7205120,206298400,2017-10-24,154941610,Andrew,Grab this one and don't look back.  Great!

The space was warm and welcoming with great, clear directions on how to get into the house and what amenities we had access too. The dog and cat were extra friendly too!"
130996,18501879,269022368,2018-05-26,110054806,Amy,Kara’s place had everything we needed. We slept 4 and there was room for more. The neighborhood was a great location for all of our activities. We had a great time. Highly recommended!

It was sparkling clean, stylish, spacious, and peaceful. We were just a few steps away from a fun, bustling neighborhood with great restaurants and coffee shops. We loved coming back to such a calm and well appointed place after a long day of exploring the city. Thank you so much for your hospitality, Stephen!"
32799,5010213,519478946,2019-08-28,85841263,Jan Marie,We had a great three day stay. The location was perfect for walking the city and convenient to drive to Boulder for hiking and Red Rocks for a show. Andrea was very responsive when we had questions. Would def stay again.
17368,2467260,69454876,2016-04-11,60087762,Rishara,"Stayed here for a week during a conference. It was a great place to stay. Very comfortable, clean and as pictured. The neighborhood that was quiet and felt safe, and was located near several good restaurants. Would stay again!"

218885,29940130,416955861,2019-02-25,139008960,Alisa,"Would recommend this place to my worst enemy. Would spend weeks there if possible. Unbelievable pad. Perfect location. Don’t think we had an Uber/Lyft that was over $12. Denver Diner around the corner has some top notch flap jacks and some kickin coffee. The Condo looks like it belongs to the guy from 50 shades of Grey. Modern, sleek and comfortable. (No dungeon) Roof top fire place is great for chilly nights and cold beers. Inside fire place is great for movies and popcorn. I bet you cant find a better place in Denver. And if you bet me, you’d lose and you’d be running around naked in the snow. 

Rent this Pad."
189330,24746875,435838210,2019-04-11,17372131,Michael,Zach's place is a fantastic place to call home base. Close to downtown Denver and nice and quiet.

74135,11722154,71977174,2016-04-30,64105326,Jessica,"AJ and Kat were very welcoming. The apartment is in a nice, quiet neighborhood. Alex and Uma (the dogs) were very sweet. 
They had lots of good advice for activities and food. 
They even got the apartment ready early for us to accommodate our earlier flight.
We really enjoyed our stay."
37339,5968656,547265925,2019-10-14,51751418,Lucy,"The house is located in a FANTASTIC location, right across from Highland Park and an easy walk or Lyft to LoHi, Highlands or Berkley.    The house is super spacious  - 5 good size rooms and one a bit on the smaller side right off the kitchen.

Common areas are big and comfy.  Great size kitchen with all the essentials.  Also, a fantastic backyard deck to enjoy the Denver sun.

Justin was super easy to work with.  If you are visiting Denver and need some space for you and your friends (and/or family).  This is the place."
158898,21435378,483662629,2019-07-07,60626838,Mitch,"This place is great. Exceeded our expectations for sure. The backyard area was a nice bonus as well with a picnic table and hammock. We were able to grill one evening and enjoy the nice weather. Easy access to all things central. We enjoyed casually walking around the neighborhood to check out restaurants, breweries, and lots of cool street art. Matt is very friendly and quick to respond to questions. Rest assured you will be in good hands."
162881,21796586,431177619,2019-03-31,1021651,Nike,"This is a very comfortable and functional space for 2 couples. We used the kitchen for 2 out of 3 dinners. We watched movies, did yoga and generally made ourselves at home. Very thoughtful set up."

70769,11127739,517820736,2019-08-25,4781136,Jodie,"Eric's place is in an amazing location, Tennyson Street is bustling and vibrant. We loved our time there. The house is older and very unique, the only thing that surprised me (and maybe I didn't read closely enough) was that the bathroom upstairs isn't totally private, it has a partition from the sleeping area but no door. As long as you're close with those you're traveling with it's totally fine. Otherwise we loved it, lots of character and personality of its own!"
65694,9882614,526913966,2019-09-09,44617534,Kristin,"We LOVED our stay at Castle Iris! The apartment is stunning and very comfortable. Loved the king bed and the bay window in the bedroom. My husband used it as a writing retreat for the first half of our stay and he loved all the nooks and crannies to write in, especially the balcony with a treetop view of the street. The neighborhood has wonderful cafes and shops within walking distance and it's a very short Uber ride to the A-Line station at 38th Blake and the RiNo Arts District. Nancy was a fantastic host and we would not hesitate to stay there again!"
178589,23455554,282945707,2018-06-28,175141028,Heather,Great home with many extras. This is a wonderful townhouse that exceeded expectations.

Otherwise, a clean spacious space to stay with comfy leather lean back couches. Nearby a great coffee bagel place with a few lime scooters within walking distance. Quiet safe neighborhood."
187003,24429845,281891375,2018-06-25,135919908,Agnes,"Patrick & Lauren were kind, thorough hosts. The room and bathroom were clean and stocked with coffee & treats and toiletries. I was surprised with the amount of care taken in creating the binder full of recommendations (Breakfast at Snooze was great!)

The house was lovely and easy to find.  The neighborhood was quiet and provided a nice place for a morning stroll.   Patrick & Lauren have three really sweet dogs that greeted us and made the stay even more welcoming."
107177,15674568,198806652,2017-09-30,15521385,Jesse,Travis' place was just as described and very accommodating! Convenient to DU and other desirable parts of town.

153202,21029294,455560790,2019-05-19,3409353,Richard,This is a room in a shared house with David and his partner. It is a modern downstairs double bedroom with adjacent shower room and toilet. It's a pleasant 20 min walk into downtown Denver partly through parkland.  There are several good places to eat and drink within 5-10 mins walk and a very popular ice-cream parlour.
109058,15817834,231522388,2018-02-01,109556457,Mackenzie,This place was so perfect for an overnight stay after picking a friend up from Denver Airport. Beautiful location with lots of restaurants and shops. 420 friendly and the hosts were so nice and helpful. We felt nice & at home in this warm space. Thank you! 
78686,12765811,309740734,2018-08-18,128096965,Allyson,"What a great place!! This apartment is in a great area, perfectly walkable or bikeable to many attractions in Denver. The apartment itself is clean and the space is well utilized, a very nice place to come home to relax. "
86946,13478248,174043411,2017-07-24,112303995,Natasha,"Overall; Nice place. We'd like to give it a 5 star review, but, it fell a little short.
The Basics: This is a basement apartment with the bedroom having the most and largest windows overlooking a garden area, presently weeds and mulch. It is well decorated and furnished, but the couch wasn't very comfortable. There is a huge screen TV with plenty of cable channels, and a large closet that should work for anyone. The kitchen is galley style and good for basic work. It has a nice shower and apartment style washer/dryer unit.
The good: It was clean and neat when we arrived for a 5 night stay. There was a nice touch of a bottle of white wine and glasses on a tray in the refrigerator. We had a technical problem with the lock, but that was taken care of quickly and we were given a key just in case.  WI-FI worked great. The fan in the bathroom can also supply heat, a nice touch. The basics worked just fine.
The bed wasn't great for 2 people as we rolled into the middle... There is no air conditioning, they have several upright fans that do seem to have some cooling abilities to them. Given that this is in a basement, they helped keep the space cool, but there wasn't much air circulation. The temperatures were in the 90's when we were in town, so, it was a bit warm.
The owners had a couple of parties that got a little loud... The owners refunded $50.00 from our total for the inconvenience of being awakened. 
Conclusion: If you are in Denver and need a basic place to stay, this could work well for you. The owners are making an honest effort to have a nice Air B&B place; they are closing in on it."
186114,24304716,534580734,2019-09-22,178014748,Hannah,My stay at Peter’s was fantastic. Very nice and super accommodating. If I’m ever in Colorado and need a place to stay will definitely check out Peters place first.
1001,39405,811407,2011-12-28,1532823,Lindsay,Jennifer and Giovanni were absolutely fantastic! The cottage is very cute and homey and the hosts were so wonderfully hospitable! I had a great time and really appreciate their flexibility and friendly nature!!

61025,9296960,163357286,2017-06-24,68763349,Erin,"We really enjoyed our stay and were much more comfortable than we would have been at a hotel.  Our kids (4 and 7) really enjoyed the personal touches and the outdoor area.  We had a vehicle to use which was nice and we could get downtown or where we were going quickly.  The food items that Mike and Val provided were awesome, it was so nice to not have to run to a store right away to get the few things we would need. The only downside was that it was pretty hot the couple of nights (temps were near 100 those days).  We used fans and it was bearable.  We will definitely stay at Mike and Val's again when we're in the area.  "
167286,22209112,282174350,2018-06-26,141769376,Francesca,"This location was perfect for my visit. the place is spacious with a ton of natural lighting. The entire place was clean and smelled wonderful. The location is in a family residential area and was only minutes away from the highway, restaurants, banks, etc. There was plenty of street parking which was perfect since I had a rental. James was very hospitable and friendly. I was traveling alone and felt very safe in my Airbnb. I would absolutely stay again and recommend James's home. "

8177,861993,164321121,2017-06-27,5390005,Karen,"John and Shann's apartment was perfect in many ways. For starters the  location  was amazing. The apartment is close to everything. We love Sloan's Lake and it is a mere 3 blocks away. It's convenient to public trans, hip dining places, and roads to get you to nature. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful.
The apartment is clean, private, well-equipped and a good size. The bedroom is much bigger in person than in pictures. It has a nice, large kitchen also. The futon and bed were comfy and the apartment has AC for those 90+ Denver days.
John was amazing at communicating...always quick with a response.
Our stay at John at Shann's couldn't have been better. 
The only thing I regret is not having enough time to talk with both of them more.  Our wee bits of conversation let me know that they  are a very friendly and interesting duo and probably have some good stories to tell. A brand new grandson got all of our attention on this journey but I'll  be back and would definitely love to stay here again.

The place was clean and ready for us when we arrived, and Hilary was available over text for questions we had about the house. Although the fireplace was not working during our stay and the bathtub needed some repairs, I think this rental was right for the price - great value, great location, great host. I let Hilary know about the tub and she said she will get it repaired ASAP. She even offered a partial reimbursement for the stay. Thanks, Hilary! "

218445,29858733,467619054,2019-06-10,266436562,Brandon,Pretty clean and nice place. It is in the basement of someone home though. Rules for house required quiet hours during specific times but when i was there they were super noisy till about 1 am. I had an early drive in the morning and could hardly go to bed when wanted. Full family living in the home above you.
173587,22936326,345697875,2018-11-05,147117632,Vizente,Great spot with awesome amenities. Food and drinks are within walking distance! Easy communication with the hosts.  Highly recommended.

237637,35260124,476686644,2019-06-26,258576819,Kevin,"I want to start by saying that Zoey was incredibly responsive and accommodating with changing reservation plans and helped to waive a cleaning fee when I connected my 2 separate reservations. She also helped with requests. The apartment was incredibly well laid out. Anything that I imagined I would want was there and where I thought I would find it, including cookware, lens cleaners, chop sticks and a variety of other tools. The laundry was great. There was also nice refreshments for when when we arrived. I would say this place really shines for extended stays and families. I would 100% recommend this place, and plan to use it on future visits to the area.
If you are travelling with small children the apartment has a lot of nice antiques and  decor on low lying shelves. We supervise our 1 year old closely and moved some things around and it was fine, but if you want a place where your young child doesn't need a lot of supervision this would not be a good choice. As a side note, one of the rooms accommodated a pack and play well. There are also closets for storing things you don't need. Having the extra bedroom for parents and other guests was a big bonus.
The decor goes together nicely and there are a few things that can give diversion when you are unwinding or stuck indoors. The TV had broadcast television as well as prime and netflix. There was a record player and a variety of magazines as well as cute local artwork."

Bathroom needs some minor fixes (shower door, towel hanger), but wasn't phased enough to have it affect me. Complimentary Netflix was rad - Thanks Yousef!"

Alex was very commuicative and able to meet me at the house-- he was very welcoming, showed me around and helped me figure out where I could get a quick bite nearby, since it was a bit late. The place is very clean, the bedroom is warm and the bed is comfy. Hairdryer and towels were easy to find. Was really appreciative of the the excellent pressure and heat from the shower since I'd ended up waiting outside for a bus on a very cold  night. Also, I had to leave quite early and there was no problem getting out of the house nor leaving the keys. "

The decor and design is really cool and the vibe is super comfortable. Full kitchen with everything you need and a spacious bathroom with everything you need as well.

Location is very central, the neighborhood got a little bit rowdy at night time with lots of homeless people around. It's Denver though hey :)"

The room was really roomy, especially the closet area. Comfortable bed, good lighting, and nice touches in the bathroom with room to store personal toiletries. Sparkling water in the mini-fridge and a convenient water cooler!  Shower toiletries provided. Plenty of towels. We didn’t use the TV but saw it had a Roku. Cute garden out back and a sitting area. 
Easy to feel like we had our own private space with easy private entry. 
Thanks again!"

Her home was clean and comfy and she was welcoming and pleasant.  It was fun chatting with her and I just wish I had time to chat more with her during my short visit!  There are three bedrooms upstairs and mine was large enough for two, and their was a sink in my room which was quite handy.  The neighborhood was wonderful for me visiting as a tourist, with restaurants nearby as well as easy close proximity to downtown. 

I had a wonderful visit!  Highly recommended, thank you Cynthia! "

227235,32062635,488255698,2019-07-14,51352013,Dan,"First off, let me say I gave 5 stars for everything. The context of our trip is important  too, we were 4 guys who were rarely at the apartment and spent most of our time out drinking and golfing. For that, Bryan's place was exactly what we needed. That being said, the place is also a trip. One reviewer called it an abandoned frat house, which I think was a crude but somewhat accurate description. It's a giant house that was clearly a few separate apartments at one point. There are 3 living rooms. The bedrooms are in odd locations. But it's cool, and having 3 bathrooms was great.
You check in and arrive by digital lock, which is super easy. The entrance to the house is through the front door, but you gain access to the place through the backyard/alley which is interesting but not an issue. There is a coach house out back, as a previous review mentioned, although I would not describe the woman back there to be ""unstable"" the same way he did, she was just a free spirit Denver hippie type, nice and no threat whatsoever. A few of the reviews have also mentioned that the shower sucks, and honestly it sucked less than I expected. It's upstairs (a/c downstairs only, keep that in mind as one bed is upstairs), so it's hot up there, and the hot water can be fickle. But I've seen much worse water pressure and the towels and shower essentials are well stocked, so we didn't have any issue with it. 
The last thing to address is the immediate neighborhood. Yes, there are a decent amount of homeless people nearby, including at the church across the street in the morning. Yes, they will occasionally hang out near your front stoop (the yard is fenced in so they can't actually enter the property) However, they couldn't have been less benign. Twice we walked outside to people out in front of the property and whoever was standing there said ""sorry, excuse me"" and walked away. Maybe this didn't bother me because I'm from Chicago and used to more aggression, but honestly I never felt endangered and we walked around the neighborhood at night a considerable amount. The location otherwise is great, it was  a cheap Uber or a short enough walk to anywhere we wanted to go.
Long story short, I know this is unorganized ramblings but I would absolutely recommend for a guys trip. Would not necessarily bring family here, but for us the location, the house itself, and the price were good enough that I would have no qualms about staying here again if we ever were to return to Denver."

They were gracious enough to let us check in early after a morning flight. Saffron was a total sweetheart. We highly recommend staying here."

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves – from the lovely gas heater to the claw foot bathtub, and the delicious treats you left for us, thank you. We also really appreciated the ease with which all communication was carried out. Nicole is a great host!"

50084,7931953,211833602,2017-11-14,99223430,Ashton,Loved this place. Very homey so if you like feeling like you’re at home while traveling this is perfect. The communication is AMAZING! They always contact quick and are there for you.
11856,1594161,185025375,2017-08-20,138199406,Anthony,"Brian and Tarryns place was perfect.  The location was a quick drive to the downtown area of Denver for my conference.  Their airbnb space was huge, about 6x larger than a standard hotel room.  They are excellent hosts, and I would absolutely stay here again."

164237,21850630,470887015,2019-06-16,19934635,Paulina,Spacious and modern feel throughout the entire place. Got around to all our destinations quickly and with ease. Parking was not an issue.

229484,32606610,495839879,2019-07-26,73955321,Linda,"The studio looked just as great as in the pictures. It is small but very cozy, fully equipped and very clean  Kitchen had everything we needed, bathroom was great with amazingly soft towels, and bedroom was super comfy with great bedding. You could hear people walking upstairs, but that was only for short periods of time. In the evening it was very quiet, and we slept great."
184467,24101544,258698587,2018-04-29,43014816,Rick,The unit was very nice and located in a fun and interesting part of town. Check in was smooth and as described.

10817,1223612,307623411,2018-08-14,179465396,Arlene,"Cynthia is a very pleasant hostess and gives you the run of the house.  There is only one bathroom, however, so be prepared to share it with several other guests.  The location is good for access to downtown and I-25,  but parking in the evening is a challenge and it's all on-street."
33489,5334219,175703239,2017-07-29,136842059,John,The host canceled this reservation 43 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

201954,26711298,503324011,2019-08-05,215274947,Sydney,"This is the WORST airbnb I have ever stayed in. Nothing matches the description given, there were creeps roaming around with the lights off at night, I could smell weed at 7am, and this guy put us 3 girls (the only girls) in a basement that not only was disgusting but smelled like dirty cat litter. I wake up to a guy completely naked with one towel walking to the bathroom. But you get what you give off, a disgusting house isn’t going to be respected and to sum it up DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!"
152015,20996662,287944918,2018-07-08,56086869,Matt,"Cameron's place was awesome for a stay downtown.  Restaurants, bars, museums, etc. are all within walking distance (or <10min drive).  The room was clean, and Cameron was on top of responding to anything we needed."
129600,18331882,274619542,2018-06-09,45776180,Will,David's apartment was very nice-updated nicely with some top of the line finishes. Easy check-in and great communication.

29932,4638352,39951682,2015-07-27,35665999,Branden,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and I really didn't know what to expect.  I instantly felt welcome and comfortable staying here.  This listing is accurate and exactly as described.  I would recommend staying here over a hotel.  I will definitely consider staying here again."
18869,2978155,38170188,2015-07-13,4828654,Samantha,"My mom and I stayed in John's apartment for a long weekend in July. It felt a lot like staying with a friend. John was extremely responsive and his apartment was comfortable and convenient. Whole Foods around the corner was a huge plus! The parking spot in the back was also very helpful for the day we had a zipcar. The place is an easy walk to Cheesman Park, Voodoo Donuts, and a few cute coffee shops and restaurants.  While it would have been possible to walk downtown, give the hot weather we mostly used uber.  We were disappointed that the master bedroom AC couldn't go below 79 without blowing the breaker.  We had some hot nights!"
80993,12972487,413639813,2019-02-17,237525335,James,Tonya’s place is very clean and well decorated to fit the theme. She is very quick to answer any questions you may have and offered a variety of ideas to do during your stay. Would recommend her place to anyone I know heading to Denver!

139169,19503543,254022378,2018-04-15,141840893,Austin,Had a wonderful time here at Kinga’s. Beautiful place in a great location. Would definitely recommend to a friend and will try and stay there again next time I am in Denver! Thanks Kinga!

10228,1145324,69329420,2016-04-10,24607803,Jack,"I had a nice time at Juliet's room was small but comfortable and I like the location very much. She is nice and easy to communicate. I would suggest a heater downstairs. It got a bit too cold for me. I enjoyed having the room next door to relax and watch tv. That was great. There is sound from upstairs. Lots of music. But it didn't bother me to much. 
Thank you for hosting. All the best"
157838,21324862,324146440,2018-09-16,184610939,Liz,"Staying at this perfect little apartment couldn’t have been easier. The location was wonderful and walkable to the majority of places we wanted to see within the city. The apartment was exactly what we expected except for the construction noise, which was mentioned when we booked but certainly was audible most hours of the day. It was only a tiny draw back to our stay, would recommend over and over again!"
216777,29488638,428664032,2019-03-25,156852370,Aaron,Beautiful rental space and neighborhood.  Very calm and restful place to sleep.  Loved the coffee maker and recommend the place to any traveler.
240096,36521451,492718342,2019-07-21,187833897,Jennifer,"I really enjoyed my stay in Denver because of this great place! Amberly was very friendly and easy to coordinate/communicate with throughout my trip. The place has its own private entrance from the outside via keypad lock which made checking in and out incredibly simple. The kitchen was fully stocked with amenities: microwave, small stove, fridge, microwave oven, pots&pans, dinnerware, and silverware - perfect for guests like me that love to eat home-cooked meals while travelling.  Overall the apartment was cute, spacious, quiet, and incredibly clean. Thanks for hosting me, Amberly!"
169803,22482779,284522342,2018-07-01,2028062,Jaime,This is the greatest airbnb in Baker. The space is a beautiful sanctuary in a hip and awesome part of Denver. Walkable to everything. Marissa is easy to work with and responds very quickly. I will be back!

4033,548897,47989779,2015-09-22,5899942,Jason,"We loved this quite, serene, oasis in the middle of the city.  Easy access to all the things we came to Denver to do.  The room was small and cozy, but not too small.  Great stay!"
56092,8732215,125581282,2017-01-06,1638370,David,"Spacious, clean and well situated for exploring the Denver area by car in any season, except winter.  I imagine the home is very comfy most of the time, but when temps plummet this older home reveals one of it's weaknesses very drafty, so tough to get warm and comfortable unless you are sleeping in a cozy bed.

Note that this house sits on the corner of Steele and 8th avenue.  8th is a well traveled road, particularly during commute hours.  Zero ambience.  Can be noisy."
122930,17331962,318838779,2018-09-04,58297534,Sean,An excellent spot in Washington Park. A beautiful garden-level studio with a king sized bed and an adorable way to leave a little message for future guests on the ceiling boards! Highly recommended!!!

169917,22494945,341705000,2018-10-27,221053174,Lori,"thepictures are not enough to tell you how cute this space is. Tina is very welcoming and so are her sweet dogs. We stayed two nights and loved being close to public transport, but the quietness of the room. Itwas a very large space with everything you could possibly need waiting for you. I would definitely go back if I'm ever in the area."
136894,19208202,214336242,2017-11-25,102904652,Sylvia,Fantastic place and location. Everything was as advertised. The hospitality super and excellent communication. Highly recommend this place and hope to return soon.

13665,1905596,13663888,2014-06-02,12055026,Patrick,"We had a great time staying in the private hideaway at 3939 west 46th Ave. Annette greeted us the day we arrived and was so gracious from the get go. She has such a beautiful home right in the heart of the West Highlands / Berkeley area. We often walked to dinner on Tennyson or for a beverage and game of ping pong at Local 46. We have a 13 year old Doberman and Annette is one of the few people on Air. BnB that would allow this kind of breed, she is a dog lover herself so she gets it! Annette is also very knowledgeable about the area and shared her expertise with us on many occasions. We recently bought a home in Denver and hope to stay in touch with Annette for many years to come."
25002,3992779,485927305,2019-07-11,81326244,Terry,Great location in Denver.  Comfortable place with a lot of privacy even with the hosts upstairs.  Comfy bed and clean space. I was traveling on business and didn’t really spend much time here.  Would definitely consider staying again

His place is beautifully appointed and very  thoughtfully stocked with all the necessities and then some. Love the neighborhood -  very walkable with tons to do and see - parking a bit of a challenge at times. Buster is the best!

The close by restaurants were a great bonus, so you do not have to get in the car and drive. Another bonus, two Catholic churches within walking distance, always a plus for this traveler."

236501,34696373,484403483,2019-07-08,30563449,Kwame,"Laura's place was welcoming, comfortable, and located in a prime area near the highway and in such a convenient location near the 7-11/gas station if you need anything at any time. Gwen and Toni, the co-hosts, were also phenomenal and are new to the area but welcoming and knowledgeable to connect with you the neighborhood as much as they can. If you're a bachelor or group of two (friends or couple, no children) then this place works as long as you're comfortable sharing a bed. Most importantly, even though you're in a place where you're sharing a space with a few roommates, every one there has a positive vibe and that cannot be valued with a dollar amount. I can't wait to visit again!"

It was extremely clean, and had everything we needed to have a successful weekend. His home was also very close to downtown. Also close to train station, park, grocery store, and places to eat. He was very friendly and made us feel welcome. Would definitely stay again."

We had 3 couples and each had their own private room and bathroom - plus a 1/2 bath near the kitchen and living room.  There was everything from condiments in kitchen  to laundry detergent. They were very accommodating with check in time. Absolutely loved it!

185108,24181855,326220766,2018-09-21,13228012,Stacy,"Ian’s place was located in a peaceful neighborhood close to food and shopping within walking distance. There’s a Starbucks within steps of the house (a win for us) and a dispensary right on the corner (double win).

I do have to agree with a previous review about renting a car. Traveling to other nearby towns would of been easier. The driveway was available for us to use if we needed it. Luckily, downtown was just a short Uber ride away. 

The suite had all of the basics covered and was very clean. 

Ian was also a very responsive and friendly host. We couldn’t be happier.

We would love to come back next time we’re in Denver!"
208225,27963397,548418628,2019-10-17,751782,Amy,Jason’s place was immaculate and very nicely furnished. He was incredibly responsive when I had questions during my stay. I highly recommend Jason’s house if you’re looking for a comfortable place to stay in Denver.

203250,27127709,469433141,2019-06-14,111320755,Mark,"We really enjoyed our stay. The location was great and close to a lot of great food, shopping and sights. House was in good shape but perhaps in need of a few updates to match the price paid. With that said we didn’t feel as though the cost was over the top and was likely based more on location. Our favourite spot to hang was the front porch with the swing. A great place for a beverage and to watch the neighbourhood."
77429,12446321,281844202,2018-06-25,326077,Rachel,"Couldn't be happier about our stay! We were two couples with 2 kids (2 & 3.5 years old) in town for a wedding. This house was perfect for us and our kids. We spent a lot of time in the fenced in backyard. It had comfy seating and lots of outdoor toys (nicely stored away in a storage bin). The kitchen was stocked, clean, 
had counter seating, and a nice view into the backyard. It was great for us adults to be in the kitchen while our kids played outside. Beds were comfy and blinds/curtains kept the room dark. Location of rental is great. Hosts were communicative and friendly. Absolutely perfect stay. I hope to stay here again!"
147787,20624536,220986360,2017-12-24,22458644,Susie,"The location was great for us and convenient to grocery stores and restaurants.  We visited friends/family in Brighton and Castle Rock and both areas were approx. 30 minutes away.

We had four adults and the home was very comfortable.  We did a lot of our cooking on-site.  The washer and dryer was awesome and we appreciated the amenity.  We also appreciated the high-end bedding and towels — nice touch.

Josh and a Kerrie were great hosts and very responsive.  We would recommend this property and would stay there again."

The quiet location is easy to access and offers a great starting point for walking to Wash Park. Peter made the steps of arriving and leaving so easy, contributing to a relaxed sense of being a guest along with plenty of privacy. The lower level space is very appealing with contemporary and comfortable design. The kitchen is well furnished, while the bed and choices of blankets/comforter allow for good sleeping.
We so enjoyed this spot and hope we can return on another Denver visit! Thank you!"
58739,9080234,302605455,2018-08-05,2350234,Cole,Tyler and Katie’s home is a great place for families especially those with young kids. They had all the amenities required for kids meaning we were able to pack much lighter. The house is also very spacious and stylish with a wonderful backyard perfect for entertaining friends and family. We will definitely look to stay here again!

Check in was easy. The house was just as it's pictured. Everything was super clean and pleasant. The downstairs bedroom and bath provided plenty of privacy, and the bed was very comfortable. 
We love the neighborhood. It's a great place for walking. We especially enjoyed the park and path beside Sloan's Lake, which is only a block or two from James's house. "

124736,17574946,221745115,2017-12-27,50693136,Vicki,"We appreciated all the thoughtful extra touches provided during our Christmas visit with Denver family. Every time we thought, ""It would be nice to have (fill in the blank),"" we would open a cabinet door or drawer and find that Linda and Bill knew what we needed before we did! Linda and Bill are excellent, committed hosts. Their efforts (including early-morning shoveling of the snow-covered sidewalk and driveway and providing a French press coffee pot, snacks, bottled water, and morning newspaper) did not go unnoticed. This apartment is spacious and sparkling clean. Beds were comfortable and showers were hot. Denver temperatures were in the single digits during our stay, but our hosts provided an electric space heater to supplement the central heating. (It could get a little nippy in the first-floor living area, but bedrooms on the second floor were toasty warm.) This apartment is in a highly desirable location, close to downtown and also to trendy restaurants on Tennyson, a five-minute walk to Sprouts for groceries. Be aware there is no cooktop in the kitchen, although there is a combo microwave-convection oven and other small appliances such as a toaster and electric kettle. We would definitely return to this lovely home-away-from-home!"

We had to in our party. everything was very clean Zach had excellent coffee for us waiting in the fridge. quick access to the freeways was great. a bit small in size makes up for its charm and character.

The location was great, the house perfectly accommodated our group,  the older home gave it a nice comfortable feel, and the location was very convenient. Getting in and out of the house was very easy and it was very fairly priced. If I were to stay in Denver again, this would certainly be one of the first places I would look at. Thanks for a great weekend!"

I traveled alone, but it was plenty of room for two people.  The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe.  Roger was very quick to respond to any messages.  There is a grocery store just a couple of blocks away and some fun restaurants on 17th Ave.  I recommend Watercourse Foods.  I'd stay at this location again!"

33651,5347637,60223428,2016-01-20,27707226,Dan,"Greg's place was great, the bed was incredible and it was just what we needed.  Nice quiet location and he was friendly and professional.
 Be aware this is not ""entire home"" as listed but more like a garden apartment, no kitchen, and they live upstairs & have a small child (be volume conscious 10pm-8am) and dog. There were never any concerns about privacy however and we felt safe and content in our home away from home. 
 Being 6'3 myself the shower was a tight fit but as long as fellow tall folks are aware this is a basement they should know what they are getting into and have no issues. 
 Great recommendations in the guide book and every little bit of the place was attended to and felt like home. Overall a great stay in Denver and glad we had the opportunity to stay in such a nice AirBnB!"

100463,14962389,464905239,2019-06-06,95759643,Dylan,"Owen’s place was awesome! 

A little bit of a walk to get to the River North District (5-10 min) but once you were there rental scooters (Bird, Lime, Lyft, Etc.) could be found everywhere, this made it super easy to get around. We took the scooters all the way down to Coors field for example with no issue. 

As for the place itself it worked out excellent for us. Pool table, entertainment system, and the massive seating area made it a great place to hang out until we went to the bars or got our day started. 

Couldn’t ask for a better place to stay in regards to value. Will definitely be staying here again if we visit Denver in the future!"

It's a quiet location, with lots of wonderful restaurants, as well as breweries and supermarket near by.   The fenced in back yard area really adds a touch of cozy to the already cute property.  The kitchen has all the necesseties, it's tastefully decorated and SPOTLESS!  Everything worked, Jamie and Keith were prompt with answers to any questions, and are excellent to work with.  Perfect for a couple vacationing or someone away for business.  It's a win on every front!"

The hosts were extremely responsive to messages and thoughtful. Little touches like umbrellas and rain ponchos were very much appreciated! Parking can be a little tricky, but we always managed to find a spot. The condo does get a little stuffy, especially if you’re traveling in summer. The window unit and fans help, but bring something cool for sleeping! Overall, it was a great visit!"

Plenty of room and extremely nice space that was legit sparkling clean when we arrived. Amenity wise there was anything you would need for a week’s stay or more. Not to mention great location, very responsive staff, as well as an incredibly easy check-in/check out. They also let us check in early on short notice, which they did not have to do but were eager to try and accommodate us. Thank you for the great hospitality with absolutely zero headache added to our trip. Our trip to Denver was undoubtedly made better by staying at Sonder."

There was plentiful steet parking. Easy accesses to Red Rocks the drive was about 35 minutes. AND on the final day of our trip we met Butternut Squashington!

The space is very charming, and my friends and I loved playing with all their pets!! It isn't that close to downturn (10-15 minute uber), but it was pretty close to Red Rocks (~30 minute drive) and slightly closer to a lot of good hiking spots relative to other parts of the city. Nonetheless, the quality of the stay would definitely make me want to stay here again. (P.S. Their band is really good!)"

The room was clean, and decorated well. There was an extra space heater, which we used but didn't really need because the blankets were so warm. Mini fridge and microwave in room, with paper plates/plastic utensils. We came in late, and his cats greeted us at the door and were very friendly. The location is great."

I loved the vibe and comfort of the space. The bed was incredibly comfortable and I was able to sleep solidly - much appreciated after being tired from travel. Mick was communicative, chill and friendly. Could not have asked for anything more in our stay. Denver attractions were a few min drive from this location. We would stay a week in this space if we could have!"
238860,35796281,492745648,2019-07-21,23639665,Joshua,"This place is right smack in the middle of where you want to be.  It's a great value.  Who needs a kitchen when you go out every night.  Sink, eh, the bathroom sink will do.  Common living space's are overrated.   Door for privacy??  What do you think this is, a luxury resort?  It's cheap, the beds are clean, shower has hot water and the caretaker is a cutie.  Would stay again."
194099,25459427,500807879,2019-08-02,171392449,Karly,Our stay was absolutely wonderful. The house was so nice. Everything was so clean and rondi is a great host. She’s very warm and we felt right at home. The location is amazing. This house is for sure a great deal;  it’s so close to everything
15842,2232323,510925350,2019-08-16,43555145,Jeri,"Country Club Cottage is the perfect name for this charming comfortable home. The location is great, set in an older upscale neighborhood that is both beautiful and safe. We could walk to the Denver Botanical Gardens, Cheesman Park as well as many fine shops and restaurants. To get around downtown we used Lyft to quickly go anywhere.  If you drive, there is really only off street parking, which was ample.   The small carport is off the alley and would be pretty tight to park a car in.   The house is tastefully decorated and larger than it appears from the outside. Yes she has personally belongings in the house, but we didn’t find that distracting.  We had the whole house to ourselves to stretch out in and relax.  And we did. THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING IN THE HOUSE.  Summer temperatures cool down quickly at night, so in general we were comfortable sleeping with the windows open and a fan.  The living room and dining room are spacious and stayed cool even in 90 degree weather with fans.  The master bedroom on the main level has a private bath; double vanity, tub/shower and private toilet.  During the day the skylights in both the bedroom and bath provide amble lighting.  There are two bedrooms downstairs with a shared bath; single vanity and tub/shower.  I slept part of a couple of nights downstairs and it was very cool and comfortable even without a fan.  The beds were quick comfortable.  The kitchen was well equipped with everything we needed to make breakfast and more.  Her backyard has a beautiful little sitting area under a grape trellis , complete with twinkling lights;  perfect for outdoor dining or chatting.  

My only recommendation to improve guests stay would be to add sun blocking window treatments in the back living space and all the bedrooms. It would be nice for privacy too."

Our only complaint is we were missing the sheets & blankets for the air mattress and there wasn't enough towels for all of the guests."

The bed was extremely comfy and I enjoyed my very own private den with large tv. Shelby made dinner and breakfast for me a few times. They are very hospitable and generous people. Their home is located in beautiful Sunnyside neighborhood which is so close to The highlands, west highlands, lohi, and I25. I would highly recommend staying here if you traveling to Denver for any occasions. Oh yes, how can I forget about Sampson and Lucy. They are my great canine friends!!!"

85178,13414484,95816406,2016-08-21,1158992,Jessica,Our one night stay in the suite was way too short! Everything we needed was right there and we appreciated all the little touches. The bed was ridiculously comfortable and the space was so inviting. We loved meeting the host and the doggie kids and hope our pup can meet them on our next trip to CO when we will definitely stay here again. Also loved the neighborhood!
38449,6187302,568617521,2019-11-24,37447490,Denis,Joshua was super available to all my inquiries. His house is really cool and has everything you could ever need. Extremely comfortable and cool. I loved staying there. We were able to walk almost everywhere.

Three of us had more than enough quiet and space. 
What a lovely place to rest and start our day. 
Bonus:solar dancing crystal rainbows in the morning!"
155471,21151336,216346083,2017-12-03,139145276,Kevin,"The property was just as described. It was spacious, clean, and modern. We loved that there was a full kitchen and Hanna was lovely enough to provide dishes, coffee, tea, and ice. Everything was within a 10 minute drive. I would reccomend renting the parking space from Hanna because parking on the street was very difficult to find. Only complaint was the noise from above. Since you are in a basement you hear every move the people above you make. Sometimes this made it difficult to sleep because the walking noises were pretty much all day. Other than that my wife and I would stay again."

A clean, clutter-free garage for chairs and coolers,  large trash and recycling bins, ample kitchen space for food prep and storage, close proximity to Cherry Creek State Park and all stores for our wedding needs (ice, alcohol, balloons, snacks, reception dinner, flowers, etc...), a private fenced-in backyard for the after-party with a great glass-covered door table and ample seating under a protective canopy making the space good for both rain or shine. Bonus: it was less than a mile from my daughter's apartment. Flexible check-in, easy-to-comply house rules, ample amenities for kitchen, bath and laundry plus a responsive host!  Can't ask for more..."

60024,9169634,159352022,2017-06-10,129947122,David,Was a great stay had an amazing time in Denver. Listing was in a great area far from tourists so you really got the feeling of a local.☺️
126463,17960399,242885403,2018-03-13,61278410,Lauren,"I wanted to love this place so much.  It was very cute, inexpensive, great location, and I loved the full kitchen.  However, the point of staying here was basically to sleep, and the bed was just awful.  It felt like the mattress was from someone's childhood bedroom and about 30 years old.  It sunk in the middle and made sleeping for two nonexistent.  

Some recommendations - I would obviously invest in a new mattress, but I would also buy a lamp to go next to the bed (it'd be nice to be able to read in bed) and a coffee maker.  We were a bit confused about the coffee maker because there were filters in the kitchen but no appliance.  Also - if you are tall, beware that you will probably hit your head coming up or going down the stairs at least twice during your stay.

Thomasa was great about communicating with us and giving us as much information as we needed.  We would definitely stay here again if we knew there would be a new mattress, otherwise I'd find someplace else to stay."

33527,5334219,531114544,2019-09-16,125721784,John,I would recommend this home as it is convenient for restaurants and bars and just a short walk from the 16th street mall and Union station plus Susan is a very helpful host.
110973,16039555,464054199,2019-06-04,103022234,Alanna,This was our first time trying out AirBnb and our first time going to Denver. Lissette's place made us feel like we were right at home! We didn't have any issues. We received regular communication from our host with tips and things we could do in Denver while visiting. We'd definitely stay again given the chance!

177270,23355811,268657877,2018-05-25,26373814,Kristy,"I can’t say enough positive things about Alex’s lovely home. The interior has an amazing “zen” feel to it, and is very stylish, yet still clearly a loved computer home. The bed was a foam dream, and we slept like babies. I loved the privacy of coming home and sitting in the hot tub, or drinking coffee in the very cute backyard. A huge bonus is the shear number of amazing walkable bars, restaurants, and galleries. One of my favorite Airbnb’s, and we will be totally staying here next time we are in Denver."

23989,3917345,76450469,2016-05-27,51611154,James,"Jiah provides a great vacation retreat. Remember to remove your shoes once inside the dwelling. Coffee is readily available, although I recommend going to ""mmm.. coffee"" for their bulletproof brew. If you're talI, you may find the desk area under the bunk bed to be snug. I definitely hope to stay there again in the future."
48521,7826191,161776768,2017-06-18,74036725,Marco,The place was perfect for my group of friends.  We were able to get to the golf courses we were playing over the weekend and attend a couple of Rockies games.  Josh and his wife did an amazing job of communicating with us and making sure our stay was flawless.  The neighborhood the place is located in was great because of the proximity of restaurants and nightlife.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
25537,4067759,202538839,2017-10-11,62736385,Sytze,"My friend and I had an alright stay at Erica's house. It was a full house. There was one other guest in the next room, and a friend of Erika slept on the sofa in the living room and Erika was sleeping upstairs. We were quite drunk the first night and made some noise coming back, which was apparently noticeable in the entire house. The house is just very noisy and we didn't realize that. We apologized for it multiple times and Erika told us that she thought we should refund the night of the other guest. But after she contacted airb&b they refunded it. She also told us that we costed her business, since this guest wouldn't come back. To us this felt very dramatic and a bit harsh. Later it turned out the guest was OK with the refund and all was good. So in conclusion the house is great and Erika seems kind, but I recommend this place only to very quiet people."

We do that in our own home, and it keeps everything feeling cleaner.  It's location was a dream for getting around, whether driving or walking.  The noise from the garage can be heard, but never bothered us, so don't let that deter you from staying here.  We've stayed in this area before and it feels very safe.  Shopping is close as well as a park, nice places to eat, and friendly people walking dogs."

AC was cold and the place was clean. Couldn’t ask for more with the host’s response time as well.  Street parking on adjacent streets or lots for overnight usually $10 or less.  Right by union station which was great as well. Would def come here again.

116894,16601681,516715922,2019-08-24,248101406,Sean,"Nice neighborhood that is convenient to many things. Host provided snacks and beverages which was nice. The power went out one of the days we were there, and since there is no television anyways and the wifi was out, we left for the day. We were kept updated of when the power was supposed to be back on, but in a message to us we were told she had entered the space to look for a leak from the mini fridge provided. We had not been notified prior to her entrance and when we returned that evening the door to the room had been left open. It did not feel as private as was described. Host is a lovely person, but required more communication than we had expected (notifying her of us leaving and returning). It made the stay feel more like we were checking in with our parents. 

With the right expectations set, this can still be an enjoyable stay."

One small hiccup at check-in (lockbox code got mixed up, there are two boxes with different codes -- I believe one is for the house cleaner) but was figured out swiftly with quick responses. Thank you Mark!  "

It is not really within walking distance to any bars or restaurants but we were downtown at the conference center all day so we would just eat there before we would head back to the house.
109691,15844892,145707669,2017-04-19,92441190,Luana,My first AirBnb experience and the bar has definitely been set high! Pictures don't do justice too the cozy little home away from home your walking into! I didn't have the pleasure of meeting Daniel but his wife an young son were super nice an attentive as well as their 2 sweet dogs that are actively outside. They have a huge backyard which is your entrance/exit point where we were able too enjoy Colorados cannabis culture comfortably! Overall amazing experience an we will be returning for sure in the near future!

Allison's place has a modern, yet refined feel to it. The bed was comfy as can be, the room was spotless and felt very cozy.
Would totally recommend this to anyone looking for an awesome night's rest and a relaxing stay :)

Michele greeted us at check in and showed us everything about the home. She was available for questions during our stay. The house was beautiful and spacious. The location was perfect for the activities we had planned - close to downtown attractions and an easy drive out to the mountains. We would love to come back to Denver and stay here again!

239997,36419998,541683104,2019-10-05,1879724,Sarah & Nick,"Paul’s place was great for our short trip. It is walking distance from the Art District and a quick Uber or moderate walk to downtown. The space is small but has everything you need with a mini kitchen. It is right along a busy road so it can be a bit noisy at night, but we flipped on the bathroom fan at night and that worked well for white noise. Paul was really nice and quick to respond for check in and for anything we needed during our stay. It was a great home base for our visit to Denver."

The property is in a cool area, more central than I thought, with a large park the center of the street for blocks and blocks. I love that look.  Easy to find and get in and out of, Jill greeted me outside and helped with my bag.  I felt like I was visiting my sister, complete with comforts of home and a little bit of homey clutter in kitchen and bath.  The bedroom could not have been set up more thoughtfully, clearly she's learned a lot in her many years.  Lamps, table, outlet, tissue, trash can on each side of the bed.  Wifi info and guest book easy to access.  TV and videos, you name it!  The bed was very comfy, the room cute with windows on 3 sides.  The shower was fantastic. Plenty of towels, clearly laid out.  Jill had hot water ready for tea for me at night, coffee ready in the morning.  I don't eat early, but she had lots of nice breakfast food offerings if I'd wanted to.   Very very hospitable!  And she let me help her with garden advice too!  Thanks Jill!!"

This house was very nice and clean and the backyard is a beautiful chill spot for relaxing at the end of your day. I hope this place will be available the next time I head back to Denver. Thank You Amy, we truly enjoyed our stay."
74861,12002460,82029924,2016-06-26,75642236,Tim,"I was warmly greeted by the host's husband when I arrived. The neighborhood is ascetically pleasing and the eateries and entertainment of Colfax Avenue were only a few blocks away. The room could easily accommodate a couple, and the hot tub and private entrance were a bonus!"

96536,14447199,278296616,2018-06-17,27749097,Mark,"This is a great place if you are wanting to stay in the Highlands/Tennyson area.  This was perfect for me since I was visiting my daughter and she lives right next to the property in the apartments; but you are w/in walking distance to Sprouts, Starbucks, and the great places on Tennyson.  It was a great place - quiet and you honestly can't go wrong staying here.  Ginny is a wonderful host."
141905,19844469,410155269,2019-02-09,24128241,Caroline,Perfect location for exploring Denver - we could walk to several restaurants/bars and to the downtown area (a longer walk but doable!) We enjoyed our stay here - great decor!
88019,13550337,183248554,2017-08-16,36487365,Alex,"Great location. Building public areas were under renovation during our stay, but this did not impact the unit itself. The apartment is clearly not privately owned and managed, seemingly part of an agency of some sort, but this was not an issue for us aside from warnings to be courteous to neighbors and not interact with front desk staff. An additional 'short-term rental agreement' was required by the building. 

The neighborhood is great, and I would stay here again!"

Excellent kitchen, stocked with everything you need to do some basic cooking. Open, full of light, enough space to spread out. The bed was suuuuuuper comfortable, the shower was hot and had great pressure. And the location was absolutely perfect! 15 minutes from basically everything, with parks, a grocery store, and a gym even closer than that. Host was so nice and accommodating, and really easy to communicate with. Everything about this stay was easy and comfortable. I would absolutely recommend it, and will for sure stay again next time I have to travel to Denver!"

10591,1223593,91658069,2016-08-06,19360957,Jewel,"Cynthia personally welcomed us into her cozy, art-filled home even though our flight arrived in Denver late at night, and she made sure to get to know us a bit before we dove into a very busy week.  The listing itself was beautiful and more spacious than we expected, with a private bathroom connected and lovely antique furnishing.  We did not think to check the weather beforehand, always being told that it's cool in Denver, but unfortunately there was a heatwave during the week we were there.  This listing has no AC, so I'd recommend checking the local weather before your trip and being prepared!  Otherwise, it is a great listing for a summer trip in Denver, located near several restaurants and the expansive Cheesman Park, which is great for walks, picnics, or lawn games.  If you're interested in funky doughnuts or ice cream, both Ice Cream Riot and Voodoo Doughnuts are around the corner and have a lot of fun flavors to try.  We also loved getting coffee at Thump cafe, just a few blocks west. Overall we had a great stay at this listing and thoroughly enjoyed Denver!"

63659,9652984,114084420,2016-11-15,20691181,Stephanie,"This apartment was wonderful! Nicely decorated and comfortable, in a great location--the neighborhood itself is quiet and residential, but it's walking distance to Capitol Hill, the Art Museum, and some good bars and restaurants. Mimi and John are excellent hosts. They were nice enough to leave some snacks and coffee, which was very much appreciated! They checked in on me during my stay, and I felt sure that if there was a problem, or even if I just needed advice or recommendations, they'd be there. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking in Denver, and I'd definitely stay with Mimi and John again if I got the chance. "
176898,23308643,445664284,2019-04-29,139765739,Loren Ashley,"This home was so adorable! Honestly, it has to be one of my favorites with all of the amenities that were included. We got to wake up to some coffee, filtered water, iHome to play some music, beautiful bathroom. All of the natural lighting and the downtown views were stunning. We for sure took some ideas of this home to implement into our own. Such amazing hosts who were there for you if you needed anything!"
121260,17175148,333725783,2018-10-07,17367684,Brad,"I would highly recommend this location near Five Points. It is located in a quiet safe feeling neighborhood with lots of street parking and one off street parking spot. Kat was very easy to communicate with and the check in/access was simple. The kitchen is modern and fully furnished. The place itself has a great feel with lots of art, antique furniture, high ceilings and several sky lights making for a warm and natural atmosphere. We had a small group and we enjoyed hanging out in the main living space. I just wish we could have stayed longer!"
97191,14593779,315753457,2018-08-29,136628387,Handaa,"Chuck and Jordan’s place is beautiful, clean, and has a wonderful view of the city via the panoramic window facing the city.  Check in process was super easy despite we arrived very late at night. The next day Chuck came down and gave us a quick orientation of the house. We got to use jacuzzi which was nice. Near by park called “inspiration point” was also nice. The bed is comfy, the place is clean, the kitchen is well stocked. Short drive to nice restaurants. Overall we enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this place. "

Jim was very helpful in helping us learn the local public transportation. He is about a mile from the train that takes you straight Into downtown Denver. 
He was always quick to respond to inquires and made sure we felt at home in Denver. 
 His home is also located really close to a couple of grocery stores and food places which was good when we forgot a few things or wanted to eat. 
We stayed for a long 4 day weekend and mostly just used the place to rest our heads between jam packs days of
Sight-seeing and had a pleasant and comfortable stay in Jim’s place."
208222,27962395,555414737,2019-10-27,253520469,Taylor,Good location but a bit pricey for a pullout bed and little room. Molly was very nice and great with communication

Everything was thought about, so many special touches, which made our stay perfect. Even arriving late in the day, it was easy to get settled.Bed was comfortable, everything was so modern and Hip. Great neighbourhood I’d stay again in an instant!"

The area was safe and parking was easy!
Jessica went the extra mile and left us little mints and offered us food and drinks!

99323,14836832,471521221,2019-06-17,93067694,Aaron,"Location is absolutely superb! You are close to pretty much everything downtown Denver has to offer. Restaurants, museums, nightlife etc..are all within walking distance. You even have the Union Station right there for getting to and from the airport which is way less expensive than a taxi or Uber.  Now the condo itself is just okay. Improvements and amenities for the guests definitely needs to be addressed. Inexpensive things from socket covers and light fixtures are easy inexpensive fixes; and I swear the plasma TV is from 1990. I could barely see it looking strait at it lol. Storage space for clothes and such is a must and this place lacked that. Now you can’t ask for a better location, but unless improvements were made, I would vet out somewhere else to stay next time. PS..future guests please honor the rules and don’t smoke in the apartment! You can find a space somewhere near to smoke unless you want a $1000 fine which is ridiculous."
170948,22552157,262373866,2018-05-08,106182691,Mary Jo,Jessica’s place was adequate for our needs.  I wish that the cushions for the outside furniture were clean.  We found them stored in the garage but they were very dusty.  The living room seats 4 comfortably.. more seating would be a plus.  The house was very clean and the kitchen well equipped. The first floor shower has quite a big step down into it which might be tricky for older people. The upstairs bath/shower has a claw foot tub.. also a bit tricky to navigate..
64158,9710417,138027850,2017-03-18,118035316,Matt,"This was our very first stay using airbnb and we cannot praise Anna enough. She was extremely responsive, flexible, and professional. This was far better than a hotel- not only was her place clean and comfortable, but she left recommendations nearby on everything from grocery stores to restaurants. The house is very private and quiet which was exactly what we were looking for. Although there is not a full kitchen, Anna has a mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, and all the dishes and silverware needed. As an added bonus, she even left coffee, tea, and condiments such as sugar and honey! Great place if you are looking in Denver."
138538,19437073,200256274,2017-10-04,71184593,Heather,"Joe's place is beautiful and he was great with checking in and making sure we were comfortable. It's not as central or walking distance to things as we were expecting, but still a quick drive or Lyft. Overall a great experience."
231818,33347156,443757054,2019-04-26,53358209,Jasmine,"Sparkling clean, it was appreciated!! This space was a great overnight retreat, it’s a gem. It was my first time to the area, their home was 15-20 min from the airport. Convenience, was my priority and the amazing host made check-in/out a breeze. They’ve set the standard HIGH for travelers with “concentrated”interest. 
My Gold standard for DIA accommodations.

The apartment was clean and perfect for a getaway in Denver. He was quick to answer any messages. This is my spot whenever I return!"
74129,11722154,67668904,2016-03-30,62024497,Andrew,"Aj was a very hospitable host who didn't bother us at all. His dogs would run back and forth which was noisy, but it really didn't bother me. Once and awhile he would be doing some kind of construction but again it didn't bother us. His apartment was clean and comfortable. The only downfall from the trip is that I was charged a cleaning fee of 140$ because he said tobacco was smoked in the house. His house was 420 friendly so we were smoking blunts, so maybe he thought that was the tobacco smell. Either way Aj again was very hospitable and didn't bother us."
159710,21517962,517837614,2019-08-25,171138430,Matthew,"If all you need is a nice place to sleep and clean up, then this place is ideal for the money. If you want to hang out (which I didn't even have time for), it might not be ""perfect."" Allison is very nice and so are her pets. She responded to every need I had. The only reason why I didn't put five stars is because the place didn't overwhelm my expectations. Certainly a great deal for the money."

She was flexible with out check-in, and we had everything we needed without asking. Highly recommended if you’re looking for a place to crash for a night in Denver."
55418,8686305,346720875,2018-11-09,16324915,Travis,"Awesome place, fantastic location! Best Airbnb I’ve stayed in yet. Do note that the guest bedroom
does face the road, so bring ear plugs if you are a sensitive sleeper."

The right amount of space for me and my dog to just hang out and relax. I loved the fenced area in back, and an extra thanks to Corey and Grace for letting me leave my dogs ""stuff"" in the yard.  I loved that the hosts were right there if I needed them, but did not intrude on my private time.  The check in and check out process was very simple. Also the peanut brittle treat was a nice touch and made me feel very at home and comfortable.  The bed was very comfortable. The only thing I wish I could have changed with the temperature of Denver while I stayed there!!! Everything was perfect, thank you!  I will for sure be back!!!!"
86503,13467564,170135342,2017-07-14,115599761,Johali,"So lovely and cozy place.  Most friendly and helpful host ever. Couldn't have been more helpful, ensuring our happines and facilitating everything. Everything about the basement was exceptional, it was clean and stylish, everything so comfortable.

I enjoyed the option to cook breakfast or dinner and her kitchen was just right. Her home was very clean and had everything we needed. Check in was easy, house rules were straight forward and basic, internet never let us down and I'm looking forward to staying again in September on our return to Denver. Great book selection too.

48402,7817254,312084679,2018-08-22,3761265,Joel,"All around great stay, great neighborhood too - character, diversity, quick access to the rail transit. I walked downtown in 40 minutes, great walk through some neighborhoods with history. You can see that I am drawn to all of these outside things, but I should make sure to tell you that, the room and house were great, and the dog and cat very chill. I can easily recommend Will's place.
Thanks to Will and Mary both"
131136,18509437,318454469,2018-09-03,12305538,Lynelle,"A great place to stay for a group of people! Paul was easy to reach and check-in was an absolute breeze. We loved the balconies, and the location seemed to be very convenient. 

The only issues that we encountered were related to the toilet and shower. The toilet didn't flush half the time for us, and unfortunately that was never resolved. The shower was also extremely difficult to work with. It was the most sensitive shower I've ever experienced, either scalding hot or ice cold. It took quite a while to get it to be the right temperature. That became a little bit of an issue with 5 girls trying to shower in one bathroom."
26697,4227772,192610366,2017-09-10,35525653,Melissa,Wonderful location and really comfortable place.

124445,17530389,448986203,2019-05-05,248306190,Emma,"The location of this space was perfect! Walking distance from coffee shops, a gym, and a couple restaurants as well. The space it’s self was the perfect size for us (3 people). The kitchen was fully stocked with silverware, plates, etc. and everything was clean!  Marcus responds quickly and makes sure to include a list of places to go to or see around the area. Really the only issue was parking, but then again that’s everywhere in Denver."
75361,12068403,271533364,2018-06-01,5177496,Andrea,"Lovely little place in a convenient location—especially if you want to go to the ballpark. All building access is by codes, which made it easy and no keys to keep track of!"
108024,15787181,149960414,2017-05-06,64783699,Matthew,"Our stay was very nice. Shan-inn was clean and accommodating! It was outside of downtown Denver, and in a quieter neighborhood. Being that it was 420-friendly was a nice touch! That was not the main reason for our vacation, but a nice addition. Shannon was very friendly,but let us come and go to site see and didn't hover . Would highly recommend if you're looking for a quieter place and if 420 is on your list. Not too far from the airport and was allowed to come in since our flight was later."

203489,27167152,333735531,2018-10-07,188961649,Kristine,"We had a good stay with our adult kids, there are many quaint restaurants/bars within walking distance. I was also very grateful that I could bring my small dog. Loved the layout of the home and common areas. The wood floors are beautiful, loved the master bedroom/bathroom. The furniture is very used and washer and dryer are dirty broken and not level. Parking is far from desirable especially since we met family which required more than 1 vehicle. There was no coffee pot, only a kurig with no way to use grounds.  Most importantly was a broken bed. We hoped to have gotten it fixed by the owner/manager prior to the other guests arriving. However, with 3 attempts of contact starting at 4pm, we didn’t hear from Kevin until the next day which required us to figure out how to fix the bed ourselves to be useable.  We felt the home was nice and comfortable, but could use a small amount of TLC to make it a top notch stay."
234553,34067851,561567134,2019-11-09,197796295,Jordan,"Our stay was great. Everything was as advertised, and Kathryn was so helpful for us. Would stay again!"

The place is within easy walking distance from plenty of establishments and I felt safe in the area.   The apartment itself was very clean and modern and had everything needed to feel at home.  The view from the balcony was also fabulous.  Bobby was a good host and was prompt with all communication.  Check-in and checkout was a breeze.  I would not hesitate to stay here again."

131010,18501879,317777561,2018-09-02,29246753,Jeanie,"This basement apartment is amazing. So close to amazing restaurants and shops on pearl street. Easy least Street parking right out front, and just a super cute and clean space. 

My party consisted of my husband and I along with our two girls. We easily shared the queen bed and trundle for while we were in Denver. (My kids don’t like sleeping alone when we travel.) 

Note: there wasn’t quite enough space for clothing storage for our party of 4, but there is space in a small closet for probably one person. Or if you’re not staying as long, then that probably wouldn’t be too big of a deal.

When we needed to use the washer and dryer, Kara was nice enough to let us use hers in her home, right inside the main house doors. 

Great recommendations on places to eat and check out as well as some super cute and fun board games are also included! Great place to stay in Denver!"

The house is comfortable and clean, her artwork delightful and eclectic. Over the years I have had the opportunity to stay in cabanas, hostels, Samoan fales, world class resorts, and penthouse suites; Jill's home and hospitality are as pleasant as any I've enjoyed, and I wholeheartedly recommend her."

Everything we needed was available. Very reliable and stayed in contact. I will definitely book again the next time I'm in Denver! Thank you so much!"

144270,20211196,531067076,2019-09-16,6105697,Alexandra,"Leslie's place is amazing! My parents were visiting me from out of town, and we wanted a place for them to stay close to our house (since we don't have a guest room in our house). Spacious and clean, this AirBNB is in a great location. I absolutely loved all of the books and games that they had in the room. The coffee and mini fridge were great as well. She was very communicative and helpful during our stay as well. I look forward to having my parents stay here again the next time they are in town. Thank you so much, Leslie!"

173443,22922557,402809268,2019-01-19,60440341,Leah,"This was one of the best properties I have rented through Airbnb.  The location was great - neighborhood was quiet, easy to get to, coffee shops & restaurants within easy walking distance.  It was clean, the kitchen was perfect, the bed & sofa were very comfortable.  Wish it had been warmer outside so we could've enjoyed sitting out on the back patio!  CJ thought of everything a guest might need.  Will definitely stay here again when I'm back in Denver!"
231985,33365990,503221403,2019-08-05,118100284,Julianne,"Wonderfully remodeled basement with a modern flair. The shower was incredible - definitely the best shower we ever used on Airbnb! For being in the basement, the ceiling wasn’t noisy from movement above, and we slept deeply on their fresh linens. Very reasonably priced for the Denver area."
177417,23377216,303590297,2018-08-07,30021062,Steve,"Granny's Flat was more than we expected from just seeing the photos. It was like walking into a new modern apartment as the very first renters. Everything was spotless clean and convenient. Full sized, brand new appliances were a great feature compared to other locations we considered. The high level of tech features was also impressive with digital controlled A/C and heat, heated bathroom floor, automatic vent fan, full sized water heater and high end fixtures. The kitchen alone was as spacious and complete as anyone's home. Beautiful contemporary designs and finishes added to the enjoyment of the space. Wifi and big screen with local channels and streaming TV service was great to have when not out exploring the nearby cool restaurants and shops. This is our go-to place to stay now when in Denver. "
186038,24304716,422950471,2019-03-12,23229529,Carlisle,Awesome place. Extremely clean and spacious. Close to the airport and a great place to stay.
34550,5433111,241110621,2018-03-07,55691771,Claire,Apartment was great! It was small and simple but perfect for 1-2 people or a small group that doesn't intend to hang around the space that often. Very easy check in process. Onsite parking made it incredibly convenient to go out and explore Denver.
4511,632709,430028901,2019-03-29,31241823,Laurie,"Lola Place was terrific for a week's stay: walking distance to downtown (2 miles or so), easy access to major highways, close street parking. Plenty of room to spread out and all of the amenities! My one caution is that it's an 1890's row-house with both bedrooms upstairs; these stairs are very narrow. This wasn't a problem for us, but could be for guests with mobility issues. 
All in all a lovely place!"
79890,12890649,441349431,2019-04-21,41943664,Tomo,Great place with ample room for a large group. Plenty of bars and restaurants close by and a short uber ride from other attractions. So much value in Cecilia’s place!
64086,9710417,71043414,2016-04-23,18514801,Francine,"Anna was a remarkable host , she is kind and considerate and has a lovely carriage house with all the amenities one would need. It is in a great location , with easy access to downtown Denver or to Cherry Creek. Everything was clearly communicated from how to get to her home, to how to get on the Internet.  This is a very unique place to stay in and I would happily return without hesitation. It is decorated nicely and was very clean with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in! "

388,590,17135809,2014-08-07,19367049,Michael,Jill was a great host with a very cozy home and very helpful to us roadtrippers (especially since we came so late at night). She checked up on us and made sure we had everything we needed. She gave us great advice for touring the city.
131324,18544743,156720167,2017-05-31,60991422,Philip,"Elizabeth's studio is a very comfortable space and is super convenient. When I booked it I thought it was a good location, but didn't realize just how great a location it is until I was there. It's less than a 10 minute walk from Union Station, even shorter to the light rail station, close to The Highlands and LoDo. Definitely would stay there again. The immediate area is booming with high rise construction, so apparently a lot of other people think it's a great location too, or will soon find out."
33115,5070640,503889412,2019-08-06,150510145,Yvette,"Perfect location and beautiful place to stay. Temps were in the 90’s during out visit, but it was nice and cool inside. The fruit basket was a nice and unexpected touch. Great value for the area!!!"

220360,30367993,463091069,2019-06-02,185030135,Tim,This unit had spectacular views in the perfect location.   A great value overall.
180955,23740719,456454613,2019-05-21,56202627,Holly,We really enjoyed our weekend here! Close to a lot of cool areas of town. Hosts were very responsive and checking in and out was super easy. Would recommend!
235891,34474444,557314868,2019-10-31,88475865,William,"The place is beautiful and in a great location. Really enjoyed walking to all the shops and restaurants, even in a snow storm, that were just blocks away."
211475,28609607,403303324,2019-01-20,127891531,Alejandro,"I would rate Megan’s place a 100/5 stars if I could. Her place is perfect and she was super helpful when we had trouble getting checked in. She was very responsive and understanding! Her place is beautiful, clean, and so comfortable. There was so much space and it was just perfect. We were sad to have to leave but can’t wait to come back. Thank you Megan, your place is amazing and we will be back!!!!"
163063,21803491,359929091,2018-12-18,227063285,Renee,"Leon was great to respond quickly, provided lots of local info and we loved the quiet location only a few blocks (easy walk) to Union Station where there were lots of restaurants and nightlife.  We really liked Pig and Sprout across the street. Building has a great gym and rec room. Minimal furnishings with lots of space provides a contemporary atmosphere.  It was unique and different but perfect for us. Would stay again for sure!"
65344,9770909,502425421,2019-08-04,12399834,Emily,"The pictures make the house look a lot nicer than it actually is. The picture of the bedroom is not accurate as there is no headboard - just a bed on a frame. The air conditioner window unit in the bedroom continued to blow the fuse for the bedroom, which we had to reset multiple times.  Neither AC fully cooled the house and the thermostat read 83° at about 4 in the afternoon. He offered to come take a look, but we only had a night left, so we declined. This place is not really in any short waking distance to any restaurants, bars, or shopping. Here is the kicker- check out was at 11:00am and the cleaner was walking in the house (didn’t even knock) prior to our checkout time.  All in all, I would not recommend this place."
171345,22612423,535993847,2019-09-25,198290245,Alexus,"Marilyn, on a personal level, is like the “cool aunt” every family has. As a host, she was hospitable and made our stay very comfortable. Most impressed by how she really thought of everything to accommodate all our needs. Her basement was perfect for our stay in Denver. Would recommend to a friend / stay again."

125748,17664945,494598420,2019-07-24,206504361,Brandi,The space was eclectic and fulfilled the vibe we wanted while visiting Denver. Randall’s space is thoughtful and clean. Would love to stay again and for longer!

82647,13059132,551921301,2019-10-20,82368885,Molly,"Very clear and quick communication! Warm hosts. The place is very affordable, however we dealt with homeless every single time we came to and from the location and a younger guy in a mask was digging through the trash. I think an entrance from the front / main house would make a huge difference. I didn’t feel safe a lot of the time and had a hard time sleeping. The inside was cute and well thought out with nice touches, however it does look a lot nicer in photos and feels funkier in person. There was a gap in the front door on the top and bottom and it was very windy when we stayed so it felt cold near the door. Overall a cute spot, but I think it’s worth spending the extra money to stay somewhere safer and upgraded. I think this would be good for one night! We stayed a few. It got the job done! It’s very conveniently located, you can walk to a lot of restaurants but be careful walking back through the alley."
50917,8071897,467671969,2019-06-10,64453161,Chelsie,Our stay at Erica & Brianna’s place was outstanding!  Check in was super easy & the space was very clean. Location was perfect for us we could walk to many places and Uber’s to down town were very cheap.  Erica and Brianna recommended a few places to us with very quick responses. If we are in Denver again we will certainly stay here! Thanks for everything
86875,13474217,548088958,2019-10-16,1646659,Kathrine,This place was great for several of us going to a concert at the Fillmore just down the street. Definitely recommend for large parties who need multiple bathrooms to get ready in :) Kinga was super responsive and helpful.
1097,39405,8985589,2013-11-30,1737913,Elliott,"This is one of the cutest listings I've ever stayed in.  Giovanni was so polite and helpful during my stay.  The cottage had everything I could ask for.  Jennifer and Giovanni were also very accommodating and provided me with allergen-free bedding, take out menus, beverages, access to the hot tub and movie screening area. I will DEFINITELY be staying with them again in the future. "

213318,29013476,551866523,2019-10-20,63152312,Maria,"Candice’s place was so quaint and cozy, with amenities nicer than my own home! The space was small, yet very clean and set up in a way that made it feel like plenty of space. Everything was easy to operate and understand (only one TV remote! Always a disaster when you have to be a tech wiz to figure out a tv). The location was perfect, I’ve been to Denver over a dozen times to visit family, and this neighborhood was new for me to explore. Overall, a really lovely place to stay and while I didn’t get to meet Candice, she was very available and communicative."

41256,6623325,154060636,2017-05-22,21701556,Justin,Kelly let us book last minute after our previous plans had fallen through. We were very grateful for her and her family letting us into their home at the last minute. The house was in a nice neighborhood and the room we stayed in was perfect for our needs. The shower was great!

197057,26029313,539995723,2019-10-02,12938277,Nancy,"Honestly, there aren’t enough stars for this listing. When I first walked in, I was amazed at how it looked even better than the photos! The decor is both welcoming and stylishly modern at the same time. Cindy’s eye for keeping the environment functional, uncluttered and cozy works well for guests in regard to relaxing, as well as, staying organized for daily Denver adventures. 
The notebook of information provided by the hosts lacked nothing for a new visitor. It was a resource we used often. 
The Stapleton location was both quiet and peaceful while also convenient for dining, shopping & all highway access. 
We stayed for two weeks and never encountered a problem. The quick responsiveness by Cindy was beyond what a guest would be expect. On top of that, her pure graciousness was constant so that we felt everyday like we were staying with friends. 
If you want the best ever Airbnb experience, here’s your place!"

112865,16163913,484386657,2019-07-08,48592803,Janie,"The apartment is as pictured & you can tell Molly paid attention to details that really take it up a notch. The bathroom is so nice & the bed is very comfortable! Molly was responsive when we needed help.

2 things to note: 1) the entrance to the apartment isn’t totally private. The backdoor leads to a split staircase- up is another locked door to the main house, down is a curtain to the airbnb apt. Molly & doggy use the back door as well & since it’s just a curtain between them & your staircase, you’ll hear it unless you’re in the bedroom with white noise going. I found it startling, but if you know to expect it it’s not a big deal. 2) We returned to the bnb 2-3x to find the backdoor ajar/unlocked, leaving the apt unsecured. Although- the odds of intruders in that neighborhood are slim to none, and there’s even less chance at this house bc of the tall fence, and I assume Molly was home at the time. If those two things aren’t issues for you, I think you’ll really enjoy your stay here!"
58648,9062588,140400091,2017-03-29,41881372,Justin,The host canceled this reservation 85 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

11136,1402409,32467281,2015-05-18,27479651,Candace,"We absolutely LOVED our stay in Pamela's home.  Her home is spacious and extremely well-kept.  We had 3 generations of my family hanging out together for my brother's college graduation and we felt so comfortable in Pamela's home; it was as if it was our own.

Pamela is clearly an artist and many times throughout the day we would go on a tour of the hallways, bedrooms and living areas to explore all of the beautiful artwork - placed appropriately and delicately around the house.  We always managed to find something new on every tour!  Pamela creates her own stained glass art pieces and they were gorgeous to look at and filled so many different windows with inspirational fun!

We felt it was a true honor to stay in Pamela's home and treating it as our own was very easy.  I have always told as many people as I can about what a wonderful trip we had and that we, happily, spent most of it in our home away from home.

I highly recommend sharing in Pamela's generosity if you can.

thank you Pamela - from all of us."

96870,14538608,269052229,2018-05-26,125557727,Hailey,"This space was lovely. It was easily accessible and there was a keypad to enter the space. This provided the ability to have as little or as much interaction with the host as you would like. The space was very clean and tidy. There was a full kitchen and a grocery store just down the street for those of you wanting to cut costs on food. As mentioned in the list of amenities, there is no AC, but they do  provide a fan which is very nice. The bed is very small and ceilings are low, but that shouldn't be a problem if you're under 6'2"". The shower is a little tricky to turn, but to turn it on you pull from the tub facet to get the shower going. Overall the space was great, Sam was nice to work with and very responsive if needed."

6679,769437,5839146,2013-07-18,7055373,Holly,Joel and Simone were fantastic! They made us feel at home while also giving us our space. The bed was super comfortable and we slept great! Simone makes really great granola and it was nice to know that breakfast was available to us. Joel had good input on what to do while stayed in Denver and had lots of guide books for hiking that we looked at. All around it was a great fit and we hope to be staying with them again on our next trip!

202379,26849559,348086346,2018-11-12,1298672,Jarod,"Sarah's place is in a great location. It shares an alley with a cozy coffee shop and a fun Mexican-themed bar. One note to potential airbnbers, this is not a residence, and though we had planned to cook based on the beautiful kitchen, there is really ONLY olive oil, salt and pepper. So if you do plan on cooking, you should plan on purchasing all of the supplies. Specifically there are no coffee supplies (though there is a machine) which means you really should checkout Bardo coffee shop."

He was extremely accommodating, flexible and fun to get to know. He was kind and available if we needed anything, and gave great recommendations on places to go visit. We were able to walk everywhere we went because the location was perfect, and gave us easy access to downtown. We had our own spacious and cozy place to stay and the dogs were a great addition as well. We have zero complaints whatsoever and would recommend staying here to anyone! If we go back to Denver, we know where we will be staying!"

We really appreciated all the extra amenities and comforts provided (like toiletries and first aid kit, clean towels, Ziploc bags and Tupperware, iron/ironing board, etc.). He really took the time to provide everything a guest would need on vacation.

The hosts were responsive and thoughtful. The location was convenient for the multiple directions we ended up visiting during our stay.

The yard was great for our dog to be able to go potty and sniff around. Evan and Brad's dogs are very friendly. We were able to have a short play session one morning and the dogs played well with each other. I would recommend if you are looking for something to do or if you just want to have a good conversation talk with Evan and/or Brad while you are staying here. I enjoyed our conversations and they had great recommendations on where to eat and what to do in the area. They gave us plenty of privacy as well. My wife and I would definitely stay here again in the future.

I was not around much but I did get to meet Darja and a couple of her friends and her neighbor and they were all super chill and friendly people, and I felt very welcome to hang out, which was nice since I was traveling alone. The neighborhood seems quiet, and there's a good coffee shop just down the street. I spent most of my time in the city center, so I didn't have a chance to experience the neighborhood fully.

28858,4344095,70948574,2016-04-22,64800688,Tyler,"Talk about a great way to have our first Airbnb experience!  There were so many great things about Casey and her space I don't know where to start. First the communication was great Casey always got back to us in a timely and accurate manner. The home was absolutely beautiful and clean, if I hadn't have had a beer before we got there I may have even helped myself to the keg ;). The location is absolutely perfect for touring the many breweries in the up and coming RiNo district of Denver. She even provided a parking pass so we didn't get towed or have to worry about moving our car every two hours. When we finally did arrive to the home for the night Casey even took time to talk to use for quite a while. Next time we are back in Denver she will be the first person I think about staying with. THANKS!!!!"
62847,9523086,194331774,2017-09-16,10279522,Andrew,"We enjoyed our stay at Eric's. The place is in a chic neighborhood, with downtown and adjacent areas just a reasonable Uber away.  Eric was accommodating when we had questions. We would definitely stay at Eric's again."

May not have been aesthetically stunning from the outside but the place and it's extras made up for it. Whoever cooks or stocks in this kitchen knows how to cook for sure! Found a ton of ingredients that I didn't expect to see and they even had a cast-iron skillet!"

160550,21608586,566244675,2019-11-18,4204971,Daniela,"This unit is a renovated apt with great Mountain View’s.  The cabinets and closets which were not renovated smelled badly. I have a sensitive nose and it bothered me. 

The bed was comfy and the gym was amazing. The namastay business should improve its customer service but otherwise I had a great stay."

15805,2232323,58919956,2016-01-05,15430038,Eliza,"This house was even better than depicted by the pictures - warm, cozy, plenty of room for five people, and all the amenities we could ask for. The neighborhood was FANTASTIC with gorgeous houses all around, tree-lined streets, and a variety of delicious restaurants and stores (including the Cherry Creek mall) within walking distance. We absolutely LOVED staying here, and (for the first time with AirBnB) we would like to stay in this space again next time we are in Denver. Darrow was a pleasure to communicate with. Count yourself lucky if you can book this space."

I wish we would have been able to stay longer than one night. If you’re traveling to Denver, definitely give this place a shot! We didn’t want to leave."
46410,7577128,109619679,2016-10-22,26071787,Eddie,"JP and Jeff were amazing hosts. Their home is beautiful, clean, spacious, and located near the fun part of Denver. 

As we arrived we found a very detailed list of attractions, restaurants, and other activity suggestions. These were gold! 

One thing to look out for is the Master bedroom shower, has no curtain so your gonna make a mess showering. 

Suggestion to put something there to prevent it. 

Would definitely love to stay again next time I'm in Denver."
29400,4540903,69052716,2016-04-08,10564147,Eric,"A cozy airbnb in a quiet, conveniently located neighborhood. Host Melissa is super responsive. Was visiting Denver for work and booked the airbnb last minute and she made it easy to book, check in, and check out. Highly recommended."

60248,9201317,104814247,2016-09-28,8837975,Leo,"Allison and her roommate Brandon made me feel welcome. The bed is very comfortable, there is a private bathroom, and the space is secluded from the rest of the house downstairs and feels private. The only improvement I would make would be to add a door rather than curtain to the space, for added sense of security. 
I only stayed briefly but enjoyed my stay and would recommend it. 
Check in was easy and Allison was very communicative and responsive. "
3839,521072,41402205,2015-08-07,37438539,Alyson,Matthew was a wonderful host. The apartment was perfectly suited for this trip. The washer & dryer particularly came in handy as we were traveling with an infant. Great location close to several tasty coffee shops & restaurants. Although there is no assigned parking we never had difficulty finding a spot. I highly recommend this listing!
2725,142683,1259131,2012-05-10,731228,Dave,Great place to stay.  Would definitely stay there again.
8625,875596,7317009,2013-09-15,8469864,McKenna,Matt's place was great and perfect for what my friend and I were looking for.  This was my first airbnb experience and it gave me confidence to use this resource again in the future.  We arrived late due to a delayed flight from the flooding and it was no problem to check in late.  The house has great character and it close to downtown (5 minute car ride).  I would recommend anytime!

Any time I had a question - both before and during my stay - she was quick to respond with all the information I needed. The loft is comfortable, spacious, and fully stocked with all the kitchen appliances and utensils necessary to cook your own meals. The location is so centralized, you can walk almost anywhere - groceries, restaurants, movie theaters, and the best bookstore in town! It is also pretty easy to find free parking nearby if need be. I travel to Denver often and will definitely choose the SkyView Loft again!"
6175,747085,46002133,2015-09-07,40892874,Mike,"What a great 1st airbnb experience! Krista's place was awesome and her roommates were very cool, we really enjoyed talking with them. The inside of her place was very cool; we loved the modern furnishings and decorating touches. When it says huge shower, Krista is not kidding, it was huge and awesome - with great water pressure! The location was within minutes of everything. We didn't try walking but probaly could have. There were numerous amazing restaurants very close and walkable, which we did, including a great sushi place (forget the name) and brunch at Root Down ... in a word, incredible - though, get there early or make a reservation! We took Uber everywhere, which was perfect and so quick and reasonable. It was an awesome long weekend made even better by a wonderful stay at Krista's place. Krista herself, was always so responsive and friendly, even when I felt like I was bugging her constantly! ;-) Everything was as she said it was and it was perfect. We'll certainly stay at Krista's place again, on another of our journey's to Denver. Thanks, Krista!  "
67334,10266757,201491116,2017-10-08,40544871,Kate,"Quiet, private, clean and comfortable. Enough space for the two of us. I’m not sure how comfortable I would be walking around alone at night in this area (as a lady) but having a car it was easy enough to drive to everywhere we needed to get to. Never had an issue parking in front of the house. Good place to stay for GABF!!"
154838,21120569,471020919,2019-06-16,137429289,Justin,Extremely good value. The place is immaculately clean. Lorissa communicates clearly and proactively and made my first Airbnb experience a positive one.

33269,5229866,171990801,2017-07-19,21747758,Mariandree,"Daniel was very nice and laid back host. Was very knowledgeable on how to get to certain locations and what to do in Denver. Awesome place with your own path to the room through the back door, allowing you to enter and leave when you please. The full kitchen allowing me to cook for most of my time during my stay. Also located close to a Wal mart, Walgreens, and 7/11. Close to the highway if you decide to go to another city or one of the parks. When I come for vacation, will definitely look up Daniel!"
100652,14992777,162397017,2017-06-20,130332161,Ross,"I felt uncomfortable being there. I felt the host was confrontational, especially on my first night of arriving in Colorado.  I was obeying the house policy and didn't smoke in the house or nearby, but had to walk across the street in order to smoke because I was following the host's instructions. I had smoked and then walked back to the bnb. I feel asleep from jet lag and the host texted to me and woke me up. He texted me to find out how I was doing. As soon as I walked out of my room, he became confrontational asking me about smoking I told him that I walked out of the house and down the street to smoke. He said that I smell like cigarettes and it was making his house smell if it happens again he will kick me out. "
36473,5862429,45253566,2015-09-01,22508641,Tatyana,"Great condo: clean, spacious, private, very walkable location, even better than we expected from the description. We loved the furniture and decor. All the creature comforts were there; Heath even left some drinks in the fridge for us! It was very hot in Denver during our stay so we definitely appreciated the AC unit in the bedroom.
Didn't get to meet Heath in person but he was extremely nice and  quick to respond to messages. Loved our stay, definitely recommend this place. 10/10. :)"

183102,24016932,446972419,2019-05-02,238993133,Frank,"Kyndi is a thoughtful host who provides a clean spacious home, centrally located with ease of access to downtown Denver.  You can use the nearby light rail from Perry Station to easily and safely travel to many areas of interest.

The home is comfortable and well furnished.  Kyndi provides thoughtful touches to help make your stay an enjoyable experience.  We traveled from Arizona, and had other family members come from Hawaii.  We were not disappointed.... Denver is a great place, and Kyndi is a great host!"
31750,4895802,110797205,2016-10-28,107870,Scarlett & Billy,"Four of us (2 couples) stayed at Erika and Mahting's place for 3 nights and it was great! Plenty of room, walkable to downtown, no need for a car, and lots of good food options right around the corner. The only negative for us was that we didn't enjoy taking in the downtown views from the balcony (or opening any windows for fresh air) because of the highway noise. It wasn't noticeable with the door and windows closed though. Still, we'd definitely stay here again. "
50639,8071897,104479375,2016-09-26,22956280,Kwan,Place was perfect for my needs. Great part of town and excellent hosts. Highly recommend.

135683,19113386,519502517,2019-08-28,12121751,Denis,"We stayed for 3 nights, a family of 4. Kelly was very responsive and helpful, even accommodating non-standard requests. The apartment is very spacious and cozy. Fully functional kitchen, some very nice equipment (fridge, water cooler, stove) that we put to use. Note that you need to take stairs to your unit, was not an issue at all for us, but might be for some. 

The neighborhood was convenient for us with smooth access to major highways, Whole Foods at a close distance. We were a bit concerned about the pub just across the street, but never noticed/heard anything out of ordinary. The parking is not vary abundant (apparently there are many guests), but it never took us more than a minute to find a spot close by. 

We had a great stay and had everything we needed for us and our two kids. Thanks Kelly!"

I needed a dog-friendly place since my family had older cats that weren't used to a dog. Lovely kitchen space with large table and newer appliances. Wonderful bathroom and laundry facilities. Nice, firm, queen-size memory foam mattress made me think I need to replace mine at home. Quiet, upscale neighborhood where I felt comfortable walking my dog at night.  Great, large open green space in front of house with nice playground. Side street parking close by with back lane access to the fenced yard and apartment. Easy access to main roads for visiting family in Aurora or a trip downtown. Highly recommend."

Marlene and Doug were a true safe haven for us, they picked us up, drove us to the grocery store, let us use their kitchen, and pretty much treated us like family at a very uncertain time in our travels. Very kind kind people. Marlene, a true artist, the whole house like a time machine back to the 70s draped from top to bottom with the most beautiful art, canvas upon canvas of beauty, staying in their suite was like staying at an art museum. What an honor! Doug, thanks for being so kind and offering us your home, and car rides! Many many hugs - highly recommend !"

The cottage is in their backyard and everything is so aesthetically pleasing outside and in. I loved the outside being illuminated by outdoor lights in their backyard, and then inside this amazing cottage wow is all I have to say what great taste. So clean and homey. They were great hosts, and even when I arrived later then I expected  Emily was easily available to ask questions and make me feel so so welcome. I would defiantly stay here again, if I can, and highly recommend it to people. Thanks so so much Emmy!!"

She is a wonderful host making sure I was comfortable with all of the comforts of home.  Linda and Lucy (sweet pet dog) made my stay all the more compelling.   The neighborhood is an urban mix of original Capital Hill well preserved architecture along with new contemporary homes as well.  This area is walking distance to Cheeseman Park, Botanical Gardens, restaurants, coffee shops, downtown and night life.

The bed was very comfortable, lots of light, plenty of outlets, and located in a lovely neighborhood.  It was also quiet with plenty of parking out front.  I would stay here again."
98789,14800540,252471827,2018-04-10,20724978,Kenan,"This is a beautiful top floor space. You must climb a tall flight of stairs so it’s not a good choice if you have small children, pets or people who have trouble with stairs. Otherwise this place was sparkling clean, comfortable and a great value. We would stay here again for sure."

It is nice and close to downtown, but not too close that you have parking issues either. Lots of great spots for awesome food (Highland was fantastic and right across the street), coffee, and within a short drive of whatever you're looking for. Would stay again!"

78522,12685709,568719628,2019-11-24,30183621,Chanelle,"This Airbnb was perfect for our trip - down the street from nightlife and tons of great brewery's and food to walk to. Close drive into the city (~10 minutes). We had 8 people total and all of us fit comfortably. The only thing is that the floors are pretty creaky so if you're walking around upstairs, the chances that someone hears you/wakes up is high (this didn't bother us though). Communication was great and the hosts were super helpful! Wonderful place for the price. Would highly recommend!"
100124,14962328,229066786,2018-01-21,90437561,Jacob,"Awesome location, super easy check-in and check-out, and just a great place to shake up will visiting the city."

It was easy to find, easy to access the room.  The bed was super comfortable and they had a selection of DVDs to watch - highly recommend The Life Aquatic.  No complaints, I'd stay here again."

115540,16440552,188516681,2017-08-29,5209982,Justin & Jen,We had a great stay at Mike's and would suggest his place to anyone looking for  a comfortable and private place to stay close to downtown Denver! We loved the back entrance and separate accommodations. Mike was helpful in getting us adjusted and in giving suggestions of things to do in the area. The garage parking was great as well as the access to the washer and dryer. We had a lovely time and would stay with Mike again if we find ourselves back in Denver.
66914,10237203,325102989,2018-09-18,20851360,Shawnee,The location was perfect and central to where we needed to be. The neighborhood is super cute and you feel safe walking around. My only complaint is you can hear everything  going on upstairs in the main house. Her boys were kinda loud and it sounded like someone was jumping around for a little while. Other than that the space is really cute and perfect for a quick stay in Denver.
130615,18473767,436301624,2019-04-12,94549377,Francisco,"Awesome hosts, beautiful home in the perfect neighborhood for those who need to be close to DT Denver, way better than I expected."

What a wonderful surprise to be in a home that the pace and space was comforting and quiet.   Janet is a wonderful host.  She made it easy to be there with her thoughtful notes of where things were.  My bedroom had a really comfortable big bed, extra blankets, large closet and extra toiletries, towels, hairdryer, small desk,  bottle of water and a ""Welcome"" notebook.  Everything I needed was available to me, even my own small refrigerator in the kitchen.   Lovely accommodations with easy access to the freeway, Sprouts, Starbucks, Zoe's Kitchen and a bunch of stores.  Janet, thank you for making a very important part of my journey so peaceful."

66818,10237203,231771991,2018-02-02,15925243,Sebastian,This is a great place if you are looking for a very clean and comfortable stay close to Denver downtown. We arrived late at night and had to leave early a.m. and the separate entrance definitely made it easy for us not to disturb in the middle of the night. Highly recommend also for longer stays.
143985,20170743,446918727,2019-05-02,23437390,Amanda,Brady's place was close to downtown and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.
141150,19751421,406699996,2019-01-30,167385765,David,"No complaints. Nice place, good location, comfortable beds. We thought with the level of insulation in some areas of the house it might get cold at night but even with the Arctic blast we stayed plenty warm. Loved the extra blankets (why do so many hosts not include extra blankets?!) And the decor. Troy was very communicative and helpful. Would absolutely seek this place out to stay again."

We spent quite a bit of time there in the evenings and enjoyed a nice place to relax. The washer and dryer was also a nice touch during our traveling to wash some clothes. Wes especially went out of his way to send a pillow that we left back to us too. What great hospitality! Thanks for everything!
136800,19207597,355376207,2018-12-03,26750955,Clare,Ben’s place was immaculate and very well located. Couldn’t have asked for a nicer place to stay in Denver.
94154,14055472,139793481,2017-03-26,117192716,Chris,"Bev's place is awesome! We went to Denver with a group of 14 for a bachelor party and Bev's place was perfect for our group. There was more than enough space for all of us, the location is central to a number of fun areas, and Bev is a wonderful host. I highly recommend Bev's place to any group considering staying in Denver for your trip! Thanks Bev!"

It's a lovely done place with great decor, a small kitchen with refrigerator, microwave and sink and some coffee and tea for visitors. Rick was very helpful in pointing us to good restaurants. and the location for us was ideal. Not in downtown, but very accessible and accessible to other neighborhoods, which we wanted to check out."

This was my first time in Denver, and I couldn't have had a more charming, convenient place to stay. Kathryn's place is in a trendy neighborhood very close to good restaurants and coffee shops. Her place was also so comfortable and really beautiful. I would highly recommend staying at this Airbnb!!"

189209,24716577,446964775,2019-05-02,238825344,Marissa,"Although this is a stylish apartment, it was not cleaned from the last guest when we arrived. Our check-in time was 4pm and we walked into used sheets, trash and used towels. Although a cleaner was sent, this ate into 4 hours of our stay. Jourdan called immediately and apologized, yet said this has happened in the past. It happening 1 time should’ve been enough to prevent this from happening again. Even after the cleaner, the baseboard heaters were still covered in dust and the kitchen pans had mold on them. It was such a cute place but I’d reccomend staying elsewhere, there’s plenty of cute and clean Airbnb’s in Denver."
175518,23162597,339616517,2018-10-21,22782044,Adeola,"Myself and a group of girlfriends spent a weekend here and we couldn’t have been happier with our decision. The home is filled with amenities that made our stay very comfortable. Since there were 9 of us on this trip, the 3.5 bathrooms came in quite handy and everyone was able to sleep comfortably. Communication was prompt and they were nice enough to throw in a bottle of wine at the beginning of our stay.  If I’m ever back in Denver with a similar sized group, I would definitely choose this home."
38216,6185753,99435306,2016-09-04,63408724,Dustin,"Awesome place that I would recommend to anyone staying in Denver. A little far if you're wanting to go downtown but very accessible by bus and uber. Would recommend highly to anyone, great deal, great room, great time. "
182959,24015212,273047795,2018-06-04,40546059,Angela,"Sandy is the best host I've ever dealt with on Airbnb! I planned a girls' weekend trip and am so fortunate to have found Sandy's place. There were 6 of us and the house had plenty of room. Sandy has the cutest house and it's in a very good neighborhood. We were a short Uber ride to everything. Not only was the house a great find, but Sandy went above and beyond to make us feel at home. She provided muffins, eggs, juice, milk, bottled water, coffee, and wine for us. She was having work done on her roof and they were suppose to be finished by the time we arrived. Since it wasn't, Sandy refunded us the first night. The roofers didn't even bother us and the inside of the house was neat, clean, and ready for us.  By the time we came home at 9pm, the roofers were done. Sandy checked in with us daily to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. She really did go above and beyond and we could not have asked for a cuter house to spend the weekend in! "

118481,16857174,285759712,2018-07-04,70430254,Kara,"We stayed here for just one night. This place is located just a few blocks away from a trendy neighborhood street with tons of hip restaurants.  Coors stadium was in walking distance, which was perfect for us to get to the game without having to drive or Uber. Check-in was super easy. Rodney was a welcoming host and greeted us when we arrived.  He provided great suggestions for coffee and food nearby. The room was clean and exactly as advertised."

Great recommendations from the hosts,  and lovely space with everything you need. Have already recommended to my friends!!"

Selina was a gracious host and made sure that we had everything that we needed for a short stay in Denver."

He made sure everyone in our group was taken care of, especially considering we had dietary restrictions. He gave us tons of great recommendations and things/places to go check out. He went above and beyond to make sure we all had everything we needed. The place itself was exactly as pictured plus some. Super cute, modern, minimal, and functional style with everything you’ll need during your stay. There is even a beautiful outdoor space you can enjoy with fresh growing herbs and spices available to use. You can relax and enjoy dining and lounging with the nice outdoor patio area as well. 
All in all this is a perfect place to book and we would all love to stay here again."

The House was clean and had a lot of amenities and groceries and the host was so nice she let me check in early. Just loved this place would definitely book again if I ever come back to Denver...
33140,5103586,102906370,2016-09-19,3548601,Matthew,"Laney was an absolutely awesome host! For starters, the accommodations are top notch. I've been using Airbnb for over five years and most hosts miss the small yet important details, such as providing the wifi network and password, towels and shower amenities, and easy to understand instructions for gaining access to the Airbnb. Laney did all of these and more! 

The location is top notch. Really enjoyed the neighborhood - quiet with every house totally unique. It's a $5 uber ride into downtown, making it zero hassle. Laney has a great sense of taste and has wonderful art throughout the apartment. My entire group gave an extra ten points for having a Cut Copy and LCD Sound System concert poster framed on her walls.

All in all, recommended to anyone who has a group of 3-5 people. Also, if you're concerned, the trundle was no issue at all, and super comfortable. 

For future renters, enjoy! "

The kitchen is well equipped, the unit was spotless when I arrived, and there was a binder of thoughtful suggestions for places to visit as well. As someone who loves to get to know a place by walking, it was well located. I was able to walk almost everywhere I needed to be. I strongly recommend the Corner Beet or Thump Coffee :).

It was convenient to downtown as well as side trips to Pike's Peak and Red Rocks. Great views of the city and mountains and walkable to restaurants and bars. We ate both mornings at nearby breakfast place called Rupert's. Plenty to see and do. Brian was easy to work with and responsive to questions. 
232290,33454104,481942954,2019-07-05,264555099,Patti,One of the best Airbnb’s we have ever stayed in! We stayed over July 4th and were treated to views of fireworks from the rooftop deck! Stylish and well-appointed home that comfortably fit our party of 9. Perfect location. Everything was perfect!

There’s no tv which was actually pretty great because the kids spent a lot of their time outdoors. The backyard was great for entertaining and the house is a in a perfect location for those who like to walk around and explore the neighborhood restaurants, bars and coffee shops. There was a great park down the street that we took the kids to a few times. Thomas was very accommodating and I considered this home a great value. "

Everything is clean, comfortable, spacious, the kitchen is amazing with everything you need, we just could leave there! Also the neighbourhood is plenty of bars, restaurants, a very good market nearby and at the same time the house is very silent. We recomend this place with sure, we can't tell how everything was just perfect."

130466,18448203,202035991,2017-10-09,26470243,Sarah,"Ross's place was perfect for our trip. We had 6 girls stay there and it was amazing. The place was clean, there was a lot of space and the location was great. We were able to walk to plenty of bars and restaurants or take a quick Uber ride downtown. The rooftop came in super handy with the hot tub for a quick dip between hiking and dinners. Ross was great and always responded promptly if I had a question. The only advice I would give is to bring a hair dryer if you are a female and need one during your trip. None of us brought one and couldn't find one there. It was not a big deal at all though and we still loved the place. I would definitely stay there again if we were to come back."

51428,8211278,546626077,2019-10-13,133007742,Ross,"Unfortunately, our stay at this location did not last very long. We checked in and left for the evening and upon returning later that night, we found the house had been broken into. Fortunately, none of our belongings had been taken. The evening and trip was salvaged as the hosts were incredibly accommodating and relocated us to a new house within a few minutes. The new home was in a great location and accommodated our large party of 12. We didn't get the chance to spend much time at this house but it looked nice upon walking through. I also inquired the responding officer and another Uber driver regarding the safety of the area and they both indicated it is generally a safe area that is not known for this sort of burglary. I believe this to have been an isolated, freak incident and is not an accurate reflection on this property but the hosts do deserve all of the credit for their incredible responsiveness."

If one was staying here with kids there is plenty of space to play in the yard and do chalk on the sidewalk:) The neighborhood is lovely for walks and is very close to Tennyson Street which is an up and coming area in Denver.  Annette was happy to provide recommendations for grocery stores, parks, events in the area.  She was exceptionally accommodating and welcoming.  Annette genuinely cares are about her tenants and went above and beyond to make our stay perfect.  She develops more than just business relationships with her tenants and treats them as family. Would 100% stay here and recommend it to a friend.   "

We had a slight hiccup with the air conditioning but I called Sam to let him know and he came over right away to fix it himself! We appreciated that so much! Sam also had a very thorough guidebook in the unit, including info on the unit, as well as the surrounding area. Plus he emailed a welcome video to us ahead of our stay. 
We loved how close we were to the ballpark, the Capital building, and a bunch of great bars and restaurants. We can't wait to come back to Denver, and would love to stay with Sam again. "

Lots of space to decompress, impeccably clean, a welcome bottle of wine (man after my own heart right here), and no TV to distract you from getting out and seeing Denver! Easy highway access for my day trip to Boulder and lots of street parking. If you are going to be in town on the first Friday of the month this place is just one block away from the lovely art walk on Santa Fe. 100% Recommend."

The house is beautiful and spacious and accurately accommodates everyone comfortably. It’s an easy 10 minute drive to downtown which was perfect. She also was extremely helpful and caring and did all she could to make the stay a great one. I would honestly recommend her place to anyone looking for an enjoyable stay in Denver!
60563,9215811,60101390,2016-01-18,32638980,Helen,"I do not recommend staying at this place, especially if you want the entire place to yourself. He messaged me saying that he will just be at his place for a little while on the first day to help us settle in and get ready to leave to his ""girlfriend's place"" once that was done. The listing says two bedroom and three beds. It is a complete lie! What we got was one bed, one couch, one air mattress, and the floor. We didn't really mind that some of us had to sleep on the floor, but rather we were upset about not having the place to ourselves when the listing clearly says entire place. We paid for the entire place and what we got was 1 bedroom. As for the other bedroom, the host stayed there almost the entire time we were there. The living room space was also shared. On our second night, he even brought in another friend into his place and talked all night long non stop, drinking and it seemed like he didn't even care that we were there. He talked about giving us a discount because he was also staying there and never gave us one. The place was also very dirty when we first got there, the bathroom wasn't all the clean either especially the old and smelly shower curtain. I have never had problems with any of my Airbnb hosts. They have all been very nice and respectful to the people they were hosting, this man was not like this at all. If you are ever in Denver, I definitely do not recommend staying at this place. It was the worst Airbnb experience I have ever had. "

And: after 2 weeks of camping, our kids were thrilled to have Netflix and Hulu at their disposal. :-)  Markus was very responsive and we appreciated being able to drop our bags off early. The Five Points / RiNo neighborhood the apartment is in is really cool -- lots of public art and murals, restaurants, wine bars and breweries within a few minutes' walk. If you're a foodie, it's an excellent place to stay."

The home is very welcoming, in a great location - convenient to everything, specifically if you have a car; easy street parking; the kitchen is well stocked, the backyard has a fire pit, the rooms are comfortable with soft bedding, the wifi is fast and the coffee (roasted by one of the neighbors!) is DELICIOUS.  Travis and Jordy were super communicative, and had all the details lined up and sent over to us well in advance.

It's less than a block off a busy street with plenty of restaurant, coffee, and bar options, but the condo itself was very quiet. The beds were very comfortable- we all slept well. The gardens were lovely despite a cold & snowy spring weekend. The kitchen has all the implements you need if you want to cook. I would happily stay at Nancy's again!"

It's very central to many places including restaurants and shopping. The place is very clean, and even has an ironing board available if your clothes have been wrinkled up due to travel.

The room is very private, spacious, and clean. There is a private bathroom, a tv with Netflix etc, a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. The bed is super cozy and the pull out couch is easy to use and comfortable as well. 

They were very flexible about us dropping off and picking up our bags since our travel timing was a little bit wonky as well. Jenica was incredibly responsive with any questions we had as well as having excellent materials and information outlined for guests. They really went the extra mile to make us feel welcome.

My favorite part was hanging out on the back porch with the chickens. There's only 4 of them, they aren't noisy nor are they going to really approach you. But they were fun to talk to and I enjoyed watching them while relaxing in the sunshine.

Overall this was an ideal Airbnb experience. You will not be sorry if you snag this cozy bungalow, it's well worth the price."

In addition to providing very thorough information on the accommodations and parking availability near their home, they were more than hospitable on our first day. They invited us to chat on their lovely backyard patio and we definitely felt like welcomed guests. :)"

106226,15551405,509555480,2019-08-14,283849744,Zech,"Although the late check in was a slight issue since our flight landed at 8am, we had a wonderful experience. the apartment has 2 bedrooms and one kitchen, there was a bit of an ant problem in the kitchen but other than that we had no problems, it is in a great location around many restaurants, stores, and dispensaries. Would definitely book again!"
17506,2467260,193483878,2017-09-13,17841521,Andrew,The apartment was very clean and Ryan was great about communicating with us before and during the trip to make sure everything went smoothly
181986,23877844,543871085,2019-10-08,157767564,Jose,Sarah's place was great. Clean and roomy. You'll hear the family kids upstairs occasionally but it's to be expected and we were out often so it didn't bother us. By the time the evening rolled around all was very quiet above us. Tons of room and Sarah was always available to help. Great place to stay!
150996,20920175,406227488,2019-01-28,181054594,Mara,"Was a nice little apartment. Hosts responsive/great communication. Requests were handled swiftly regarding heating / mirror. Jetted Bathtub was a bonus. Easy Uber to everything in the centre. Wifi perfect. 
Would have given a 5* rating however check-out was not pleasant. There was a big snowstorm overnight and during the morning - the hosts were away. They hadn't been prepared for this circumstance. There was no assistance & I had to dig out/shovel for nearly an hour in order to get out of the apartment to create a path in order to leave with the bags. That was an unnecessary stressful way to depart. 
Hosts were contacted and apologetic. Still feel this should be mentioned."
184293,24083668,269061086,2018-05-26,186042255,Scott,"Lucas's place is a modern, bright, and inviting in a convenient location to some great restaurants, bars and breweries. The private building is brand new with high end accessories the pictures accurately reflect. Bed was comfy, towels were plush and clean. I'll echo the opportunity for more permanent privacy shades as a way to make this place even better. Highly recommend this spot and would stay again."

16436,2257217,277592122,2018-06-16,147710305,Adam,Check-in and out was a breeze. Fantastic location with downtown and Rino Arts District within walking distance. The private entrance made it very convenient to have flexibility of when you arrived or left. Great neighborhood. Definitely would recommend.
174107,23006749,253220561,2018-04-13,56343860,Ja-Ray,"Not only was the space clean and comfortable, Matthew went above and beyond to make us feel at home. He met with us to answer our questions, and made great dinner and sightseeing suggestions. 

The bed is AMAZING—definitely one you want to come back to after a long day."

We felt welcomed right away, things were labeled so we knew where to look if we needed anything. Her house manual is detailed too so everything is pretty easy to jump in to. I would stay here again!"

97001,14552630,106168139,2016-10-04,33685462,Jill,We loved staying in Capitol Hill.  Mitch was fabulous before and during the trip with helpful information and always available when we had questions.  The location is fabulous for walking to everything in Downtown Denver.  The bedrooms and bathrooms were so comfortable.  The washer and dryer were an extra perk.   Restaurants and groceries within a block and a wonderful kitchen with everything we needed.  So much better than a hotel room.  We loved our stay and will definitely be back.   
184675,24159249,415073453,2019-02-21,16502651,Ben,"Jeff’s home was perfect for our work trip and couldn’t have been in a more convenient location relative to downtown Denver. It was one of the cleanest AirBnb’s I’ve ever stayed in and had all the amenities you’d ever need whether you’re traveling for work or leisure. It was fairly cold or we would’ve definitely taken advantage of the beautiful rooftop terrace! Communication was a breeze even though we had asked to check in a few hours early. The beds were super comfortable and the shower was very spacious.

I’d definitely recommend Jeff’s place and look forward to staying there on my next trip to Denver!"
227286,32065545,547657303,2019-10-15,14603888,Hope,"This was a great place for our long weekend in Denver. Easy key pad check in, lots of local recommendations and a comfy space to stay. Was just two of us but could easily fit four in the two bedrooms!"
117487,16742127,158438333,2017-06-06,11805752,Co,Amazing stay!  Tammi's place was simply perfect! Comfy and relaxing!  I will be back for sure!
41835,6846954,508281834,2019-08-12,118897165,Shaw,"We had such a wonderful time! This was our third time visiting Denver and by far the best place we’ve stayed. Great loft and fabulous location! Prompt response time, easy check in, everything was just perfect!"
6991,787456,34153825,2015-06-05,32902434,Beth,"This was our first airbnb experience and Pamela has set the bar high!  She texted me the evening before our arrival to touch base again and then the next day to let me know our room was almost ready (early) but we could leave our bags anytime.  Pamela was very welcoming in a truly genuine way and we felt instantly at home in this city we'd never visited.  She knew we wanted to visit the Botanical Garden and she walked us right across the street to it, then renewed her own membership so we could take advantage of that and get in for free.  When asked, she offered some lovely suggestions for dinner out, and she was right on for choices.  Our room was very comfy and super clean; the whole first floor of the house was ours to use/share with other guests who weren't around at the same time, and we had a relaxing late afternoon watching  a thunderstorm pass by through the Victorian's beautiful picture window.  Our room on the back garden side of the house was quiet and peaceful.  She made us biscuits and fresh fruit and oatmeal were available to us, along with a nice assortment of teas.  We were only able to stay one night, then off to the mountains for a family wedding.  We would love to go back to Denver, if only to visit with Pamela and stay in her lovely home again! She is a born hostess and we thoroughly enjoyed her and her home."
243819,38568812,569198931,2019-11-25,78612160,Luke,"A very cozy, stylish place to stay in the city, and it’s within walking distance of a lot of restaurants and storefronts. I had no complaints my entire stay, and plan on staying here again in the future!"
206096,27599458,475779100,2019-06-24,336091,Lynn,"Considering it is an old (historical) house, slowly undergoing renovation, Geovani has done a fine job of making a clean, comfortable and welcoming space for guests. We had everything we needed for a short stay, including thoughtful touches like large bath towels (in abundance!), toiletries, skirt hangers (sounds trivial, but it is surprising how often they are lacking in vacation rentals), convenient power strips, and tourist brochures. We found the neighborhood pleasant and safe, with cute cottages and renovated historical homes, and there is a supermarket not too far away.

The space has both pros and cons. Pros include a location easily walkable to downtown (15-30 minutes), a very comfortable bed and duvet, good wi-fi, a large well-equipped kitchen, and a pleasant backyard that is currently being enhanced. The house was also very clean and freshly painted inside. Cons include rather steep and dark stairs to the bedroom, and the bathroom being down the stairs and at the other end of the house. This did not bother us, but could be an issue for some. There was a clothes closet near the bathroom, which made it convenient to dress after one’s shower. Also, the air conditioning was rather noisy (fortunately, it was cool enough that we didn’t need it). 

Geovani was a friendly and responsive host, forgiving of our transgressions, and accommodating about early check-in and letting us leave our luggage after check-out. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and felt quite comfortable."
69754,11037671,202037419,2017-10-09,97802059,James,"Jack is a great host, very hospitable and friendly. We enjoyed our stay!"

113527,16221291,189693827,2017-09-02,30942234,Melissa,"This is seriously one of the best AirBnB experiences I have had. Studio 68 was lovely and the perfect space for me and my husband. It is situated in a wonderfully artsy neighborhood where there are restaurants, little shops, bars and several awesome bookstores all within walking distance. Jeff was super friendly and helpful when it came to giving us ideas of local activities. I HIGHLY recommend staying a studio 68. You will feel at home!"

He was able to accommodate our requests with very short notice and was even out front to greet us when we arrived. His place is very nice, clean and perfect for couples. I highly recommend staying at Jack's place!"
128161,18179045,277535900,2018-06-16,85326551,Patti,"Nancy and Andre‘s place was absolutely perfect for our 4 day stay in Denver!  The accommodations exceeded our expectations!!  The two bedrooms and Jack and Jill bathroom were extremely clean and provided everything we needed and more!  I was very impressed at all the special touches that Nancy has done to make your stay all the more comfortable.  There’s a variety of coffee pods for the Keurig and selection of teas, with an electric teapot.  The fridge is stocked with bottled water, milk, butter, and jams.  Nancy would text us each day to make sure we had everything we needed and even offered to restock the fridge.  She was such a gracious host, very easy to talk to and had excellent suggestions on what to do around town and places to eat. The location was perfect, a safe area to walk, with a park directly across the street. It’s only 5 to 10 min. drive to Washington Park and Cherry Creek, and a 15 min. drive to downtown and the Rhino district.  I will definitely recommend Nancy and Andre’s home to my family and friends and will book with them again on our next visit."

Apartment was very clean and our host’s communication was world class.

83280,13156741,170472617,2017-07-15,57063322,Greg,"Christine was an amazing host! Weeks prior to our arrival, she made herself available via telephone to discuss my questions. We received a nice confirmation email with instructions a couple of days before as well. Upon arrival, we were pleased to have ample non-cost parking. For new visitors to Denver, you will find this to be a luxury when you come home after dark, as most places do not offer this. The lockbox was easy to use and we were in quickly. Knowing we were coming in late, she left the porch light on for us. We were blown away once we opened the door -- the photos in the listing do not do this place justice! AMAZING! The high-lofted ceilings make it impossible to properly photograph the space, which is among the nicest we have stayed. This unit is incredibly intimate and has only one bed. It's most certainly intended only for one person or a couple. This IS NOT a place for children, and here's why; Christine has incorporated ornate and handsome artwork throughout the unit and the repurposed nature of the unit left exposed anchors in a couple of areas. It's perfectly beautiful and safe for adults, but kids will only find a way to hurt themselves. The bed is dreamy and comfortable. The couch is beautiful and spacious. The basic cable package helped me fill the mornings when she took extra time getting ready. The full kitchen has granite countertops, stainless appliances along with a full compliment of dishes and cookware. We prepared three meals during our stay and everything worked perfectly. The bathroom is cute and functional, with plenty of hot water and high pressure. There is a stacking washer/dryer that we (Website hidden by Airbnb) nice than what we have at home! The neighbor gentleman was incredibly friendly. That was the only interaction we had there. It seems like a busy little area but was surprisingly quiet enough to enjoy the evening breeze on the bench on the front porch while watching the trains go by. The light rail stop is a block away and offers self-serve rental bikes, should you wish to take a ride. The light rail makes almost no noise when sitting on the porch and is inaudible when inside with the door closed. There is also a big park with public swimming and a waterslide right across the street, if you need to splash and play. Overall, the central location is such a great starting point for any adventure, near or far. The heart of LoDo is 4 minutes. The entrance to the Interstate is 2 minutes. Broadway area is 3 minutes. We drove north to Fort Collins and south to Colorado Springs. We didn't catch city traffic between the unit and the highway either day. Long story short, this place is a gem! It's newly listed at this point, so get it before the rate goes up! This rivals units in the area that are 30% or more per night. You will..."
11071,1363517,26956516,2015-02-22,27796582,Scott,My friend and I are on a road trip from California and wanted to spend time snowboarding the area. Jessi's place was a cozy nook for us to come back to after a long day on the mountains. Two rooms with plenty of room. I highly recommend this place to a couple or anyone who wants to be close to downtown but not in the noisey heart of town. Thank you if I'm ever back this way. I will be staying here.

This large single apartment is situated right around the corner from a couple restaurants and is very close to everything in Denver. Its a very accessible location. The kitchen is a full kitchen and comes with the basics if you are into cooking meals instead of eating out. Its a very cozy place and has lots of character. My wife and I never had any issues with noise and slept very soundly. 

Josh was quick to respond to any messages we sent and had everything in order for easy check in and check out. Overall a very nice experience!"

Beautiful balcony to catch the sunset on. Only thing that would’ve made my trip better is if I had rented a car/navigated public transportation sooner/more effectively, but if you are physically sound this might not be an issue. Overall just what I needed and beautifully displayed!"

203007,27051030,443336245,2019-04-25,97993340,Andrea,Great place to stay!
81047,12986223,107663271,2016-10-11,46426192,Savvi,"Brian's place is located just a few minutes from Sloan's lake, in a quiet residential neighborhood. Location? Fantastic. Whether you need to go on a Target run or head downtown, it's a quick ten minutes (and easy, cheap Uber). 

I traveled with a total group of four girls and Brian accomodated to our early check-in time. We had a full size air mattress and full size bed, and us four were all cozy and comfortable... despite the small space. It was airy, clean, and very peaceful with his simplistic decorating. HBO movie nights were great as well. 

The only downside we had was that the hot water would run out after ten minutes, so we had to take long breaks within showering. Other than that, I would highly recommend this place and would most likely rent it again if I stayed back in Denver. "
11245,1451057,466896588,2019-06-09,234429764,Carly,"Great stay with Chris! I was here for two weeks, and had an awesome experience. Chris was always quick to respond, and the location was perfect to explore local shops/restaurants and downtown Denver."
166981,22149209,252698311,2018-04-11,181113802,Matt,This place is absolutely dynamite!  Everything was clean and well laid out. I think they provided way more than is even necessary. Next we're in Colorado this is the only place we will stay. You won't regret it !
83001,13081152,472913689,2019-06-20,88760915,Devin,"This was my 2nd stay with Mitchell and it was just as great as the last time. Mitchell's check-in policy is a lifesaver as he allowed me to get inside before most would even be awake. The house is in a quiet neighborhood, but walkable to Colfax which has some great food and nightlife. The bedroom is simple, but large so you never feel cramped."
191868,25136700,482526656,2019-07-06,105770416,Sachin,"Absolutely loved our stay at the house. It was super clean. Any questions or concerns, Nish and Ness are just a message away. The house has all the amenities including air conditioning, kitchen is fully equipped, bathroom has all essentials. All in all, just the home away from home we were looking for. Thanks Nish and Ness"

180487,23684531,418272308,2019-03-01,188362006,Daniel,Exceedingly kind and very communicative. On its own this space is something to see and worth a long stay.
75375,12068403,289144597,2018-07-11,181827,Chris,"The place is very well kept and has a neat three split story setup. Location is very walkable to the ballpark, Union Station, bars and restaurants. Jessica responded ASAP which was great as we were only looking for a one night spot. The area has some vagrants, particularly where the parking space is in the alley out back, but this should not deter (Website hidden by Airbnb) city life. Would be happy to stay again."
48738,7843605,140383573,2017-03-29,75103308,Kaitlyn,We enjoyed staying in the apartment and the hot tub was a definite plus! The location is just a quick drive to anywhere else in the city. Cynthia is also an excellent host! She is extremely responsive and was quick to address any small things that came up. 
55456,8686305,557250522,2019-10-31,30102583,Anne,Billy’s place is a perfect place to stay in Denver! His home is beautiful and our room has a view of Central Park! He’s always a great host and we choose to stay there whenever we are town!

87276,13494022,135879081,2017-03-06,46695672,Sean,"Jake's place was great. The house is very nice and in prime location. Pretty much one block away from everything in uptown/capitol hill and a 10- 15 minute walk to downtown. The basement was very accomodating. And we had the entire bottom floor to ourselves. Check in was super easy. No key needed, just a number combination lock. Spent most of the days snowboarding but I met Jake twice and he is a cool dude. We hung out and watched some gopro footage of him skiing beaver creek, and then he gave us some recommendations for places to go in the highlands. The best parts of the house were the shower, 2 tvs with Direct Tv, and and back porch, where we ended our nights with a little  420 celebrations. Overall, I would definitely stay again."

Very convienent to downtown and around too. All of the reviews are true. Clean, convenient, everything you may need or forgot...shampoo, toothpaste etc. 
The breakfast! Seriously, breakfast is included. Homemade scones or homemade granola and fruit. Hard to choose.  I wish I could attach a picture. As beautiful  presented as tasty."

52837,8410937,185451331,2017-08-21,29187955,Christopher,Dave's place was exactly as advertised. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and had no issue.
122350,17303217,228030381,2018-01-17,11824208,Christine,"This is a beautiful and sparkling clean home that is super comfortable. The host made me feel at home with all the little extras and the book of recommendations for places to eat and things to do in town. Steven was phenomenal at communicating with me the entire time and was SUPER fast with his responses. Loved that it was walking distance to the supermarket, some restaurants, and a few stores. It was my first Air BnB stay and I’m hooked now. Great price and fantastic place! I would highly  recommend staying here!!! "
106693,15631740,332606310,2018-10-05,111676823,Eva,"We stayed one night and were pleased. The house is close to places to eat, and was clean and comfortable."

32713,5010213,84891419,2016-07-09,57203071,Karen,"Great and clear communication and directions about the place. Location to downtown, Union Station, restaurants, shopping and the 16th Mall free bus was very convenient. Everything within walking distance. All we needed was in the loft, and having a laundry closet in the space was a real plus for my group of four. The only negative is the noise from the trains. It also would have been nice to have a second key, but having a lock box for the one we did have worked out just fine."

65393,9779508,519004258,2019-08-27,62839154,JoAn,"Gina and Bryan were wonderful hosts - very responsive and concerned about making our stay comfortable and enjoyable.  Communication before and during our stay was just right.  We had our privacy but since they were on sight for much of our time there, they were able to respond immediately to any questions we had.  Bryan greeted us upon arrival and checked on us during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed.  We also met Gina and their two children during our stay.  The apartment was clean and bed was comfortable.  The location was perfect for us.  Washington Park is a great place to take a walk and we enjoyed using the tennis courts one morning.  So many things within walking distance but also a quick, inexpensive Lyft to downtown area for a wedding we were in town for.  I would highly recommend Gina and Bryan’s place!"

She was very accommodating to our late arrival time and helpful with tips around town, as it was our first trip to Denver. Our favorite feature was the deck, with a great view of the city — we enjoyed relaxing morning coffees out there!"

124302,17530389,143612236,2017-04-12,105926064,Lauren,"Our stay was, in one word, AMAZING!  Marcus and Holly are incredible hosts.  They were home with us for most of the week.  We spent time chatting a bit, but they were great about giving us space...felt like we had the place to ourselves.  They were also super helpful and provided us with a list of their favorite spots around the city! 

The apartment is lovely...clean and cozy!  It is a short walk (about 5 blocks) to Broadway which has a ton of restaurants and bars and maybe 15-20 minute walk to the rail station.  Convenient to get into the heart of the city (5 stops maybe...?) but also tucked in jussssst far enough that you are in a quiet residential neighborhood if you want to sleep in/go to bed early.

We loved it!!!!"
114491,16313550,240450194,2018-03-04,3197622,John,"Great location. Walking distance to tons of eateries, coffee shops, restaurants... Had a great lived in feel. Lately a lot of AirBNB's feel like hotels or rental properties. I like the feel that someone lives there. Like I am a friend they invited to stay at their house. Whitney and Mitchell were available for questions and offered good tips one local activities."

It was a privilege to learn the history of Henry Lee and enjoy the comfort of a home built when craftsmen took great pains to make every detail count.

My only complaint is the neighbours in the building were loud and they had a party on the weekend so it was difficult to sleep.  Otherwise, the place is clean, laundry was very handy, and the TV had Netflix and Amazon TV which was nice as well.  Thanks!"

I felt completely safe walking around the area during the day and the instructions provided made it easy to check-in  to the room when I arrived. The space itself was clean and I enjoyed working on the private patio in the mornings. Overall I enjoyed my stay and would recommend to others!

Patrick’s urban farmhouse is clean, neat , and perfect for a stay in Denver . I will definitely stay there again on my next trip to Denver . This is the place to stay . Don’t bother looking at other options .

The house itself was the perfect size for our party of 8. Everyone had a place to sleep and we fit very comfortably hanging out in the living room/kitchen area.

I communicated with Daniel throughout the lead up to our stay and appreciated his quick responses to my questions. I would be happy to stay with Daniel on any other listings he has and would highly recommend booking this place for your trip to Denver!"

24052,3917345,265074248,2018-05-15,69668149,Jess,Jiah was a great host. She was very friendly and gave me lots of insider tips about places to check out. Would definitely stay with her again!
39793,6374807,99740746,2016-09-05,34468669,Danny,Great location for a long weekend in Denver. Ryan was very accommodating with our check-in process and very helpful with questions. The location is perfect for anyone looking to explore Denver with ease; would definitely recommend!
95731,14369542,340385857,2018-10-23,179328702,Salehin,"Jenn and Jay have very beautiful house and very nice setup. The house was very clean and specious .
The location close from the airport as well as from the downtown. We enjoyed the place."

10555,1223593,34734566,2015-06-11,2451243,Thanh,"This was an all-around fantastic stay!  Cynthia was a delight, sweet accommodating, friendly host.  We chatted and had wine every night (along with another house guest), and it was a lot of fun staying here.  I felt very at home and more like a house guest/friend than a hotel guest, if you know what I mean.  

The house itself was full of charm and personal touch.  Not to mention so much sun-light filling every room and all the flower arrangements, plants, and artwork.  the front porch was also a great place to sit and take in the neighborhood. loved it.

As for my room,  I adored it.  Had so much character and period details.  I had my own bathroom so it was perfect.  I stay at a lot of bed and breakfasts, and I make sure to look for the older victorian homes, and this being one of them, but this is really up there in my experience.  I liked it so much, I rebooked for later in the month when I am returning to Denver!  :)"
239796,36242292,524349587,2019-09-05,88771899,Randy,The space was very nice.  I would stay again.  Everything was as described in the post.
175833,23215919,415409900,2019-02-22,144037218,David,"This is a perfect layover for a group/family for an early flight out or late flight into Den airport, before or after a ski trip. I was traveling with 3 teenager boys so we were able to spread out among the 5 beds available. 


We were able to leave at 4:15 make a short ride to rental car drop, take shuttle to airport, drop bags and get to plane by 5:30 for 6:05 flight."
211721,28689249,364930193,2018-12-31,133754512,Crista,"The house is wonderful very spacious and clean. It had plenty of appealing amenities. The house was wonderful to spread out and relax after a fun filled day in Denver. However, it is located across the street from a Drug Rehab Facility which had some strange people hanging around at odd times of the day. If it is just a couple or friends going I would say it would be okay. However, a family with children made us feel a little uneasy at times. They are wonderful hosts and this is the only thing I wish I would of known before our visit."
219464,30109318,432693574,2019-04-04,39756526,Bonnie,"Location ideal for museums.  Interesting neighborhood.  Space worked very well, especially to have 2 1/2 baths.  Keypad makes checkin and check out easy.  Nicely appointed."
177313,23355811,469483101,2019-06-14,67450688,Trevor,Good location in a fairly central spot. Close to bike paths and much cheaper than local hotels. Groceries are nearby and easy Uber access. Rooms are comfortable. Bit of an older property but great place to stay.
99774,14932614,168939871,2017-07-10,88046819,Alfonso,"Wow, was I surprised! I come to Denver a couple times a year, and usually stay in hotels. Joseh's place is in an area I wasn't familiar with but the price was right for my budget, and as I drove the last couple miles to his house I realized how close I'd be to a lot of the happenings I love. The adorable bungalow was in a quiet neighborhood, and chilling in the backyard was great morning and night. The view of downtown was great. I'm definitely looking for this house next time I'm in town."
138487,19436429,471956172,2019-06-18,258580854,Amanda,Awesome place! We had so much fun!
194874,25549371,480383796,2019-07-02,26372294,Tara,Check in was easy. Place was spotless. Location was near everything you’d need. Scott and Shelby go above and beyond to provide local tips and extra toiletries. Would definitely recommend pulling the trigger if you are on the fence about this one!
208319,27985057,331048345,2018-10-01,214732784,David,"Incredible house! Plenty of room, completely spotless, well decorated, plenty of amenities, a second floor balcony, and a rooftop patio to top it all off! Joe was a fantastic host---super helpful about making sure we knew all of the places in the surrounding area that we were interested in, and responded immediately if we had any questions or needed to get in touch. You can tell the location is up and coming, which is great since everything you could need is within walking distance---and the busier downtown nightlife is only a short 5 minute ride away. It was our first time visiting Denver and I can't recommend staying here enough. The trip seriously couldn't have gone better, would absolutely stay here again!"
34675,5500958,235705143,2018-02-17,56863911,Raija,"Amazing stay at Casey’s. It was so clean upon arrival and he left us a note welcoming us to the area. Checkin directions were clear as could be. Amenities everywhere, from coffee and tea, Netflix on the tv, WiFi, fan and sound maker for sleep and free local beer. There was a book of tips and ideas as well as numerous brochures for acitivites and a few books with hiking trails etc. the distance is walkable to snooze, coors field and the 16th street mall- or a very short inexpensive cab ride if you don’t feel like walking. You never hear the neighbors and the area is very quiet. I had a few questionsfor Casey and he was super quick to respond. I would definitely recommend staying here if you get the chance!"

188986,24689489,455486105,2019-05-19,260220206,Payton,10/10 recommend staying here! It’s right next to University of Denver and close to so many amazing places in Denver or around the mountains! Susan was very hospitable and I would definitely use her as an Airbnb again if I come back to the Denver area!
193236,25341724,513642439,2019-08-19,67053654,Lianne,"The cozy cottage was clean, private and the location was super!"
199303,26281796,517783240,2019-08-25,8678008,Prapti,Excellent hosts. The place is close to the airport - I used public transportation to get to the airport after my stay. The bed is comfortable. Small fridge and micorwave in the room were handy. They have an iron that guests can use - I love that! Thanks Monica and John!
22114,3562277,99732271,2016-09-05,85206182,Samantha,Best air BnB experience I have ever had!! Michelle is so sweet and her home is amazing. Not once did I feel like a stranger!!
218719,29881875,537428577,2019-09-28,74379773,Stephen,"The Airbnb was quite spacious, however although we knew the suite was in the basement, it was extremely loud when the hosts and their dog walked around. Considering how loud it is, that should have been disclosed. It seemed liked there were a couple of dinner parties that took place while we were there, which made it impossible to go to sleep early. There was also no door to the suite, so it felt like there was no privacy and we found ourselves whispering. 

Just considering this fact , I would not recommend staying here. Once they install a door to separate the guest suite and their home , this would be a great place ! 

Also, there is not a television inside the Airbnb either, which would drown out at least some of the noise. 

Friendly hosts, great location, clean as all heck - just needs a door and better insulation."
116710,16589595,531084020,2019-09-16,4588102,Taunya,"Clean, close to the airport and a great value!"
93159,13972526,181413965,2017-08-12,97681541,Gena,"House is nice and clean. Great neighborhood and grocery stores and some great restaurants within short distances. Minutes from the city and family attractions. Mountains are also a short drive east! Only had to bother our host a few times and they where prompt to get back to us. We were actually in the house just to eat dinner, sleep and shower. Moms of teens, this is a great house to bring them together, eating at the dinner table and having to agree on evening tv. Lol and yes there is wifi!"
195259,25614605,291247579,2018-07-15,198278352,Tom,Zack is off to a great start.  Since I was his first guest I made some suggestion that should put him over the top.  If I am ever back I would stay again
30077,4638352,286224340,2018-07-05,161189864,Richard,Excellent place in a great location! Portia and Tracy were incredibly helpful for any of our needs. Would definitely recommend!

I appreciated the small things like hand-written notes, and little treats in the room (a jar of candies, water bottles, and a bunch of brochures and recommendation lists of things to do in Colorado)."

79875,12890649,273014041,2018-06-04,172403179,Nam,This place is huge and is very centrally located.  It's an older charming house that was able to accommodate my group of 20.   Cecilia was very accommodating and was always fast in responding to any questions I had.  It made the whole experience very enjoyable.  I would definitely recommend this house if you're planning a Denver trip especially with a bigger group. Thanks again Cecilia!
184210,24066553,347709784,2018-11-11,54785669,Cass And Will,"Wayne's lovely home is in the perfect location in Denver, close to downtown but nestled in the highlands close to some smaller cafes, boutiques, and local spots (plus there's parking!). The heater works great which was a huge plus as it snowed while we were there! We enjoyed our weekend there so much, thank you for having us!"
50691,8071897,152064443,2017-05-14,122475801,Dan,"Great spot! In walking distance and/or a short Uber ride to plenty of great bars, restaurants and breweries. Neighborhood is quiet with plenty of parking. Just make sure to watch out for the street sweeping signs! I did not have a chance to meet the hosts, but they recommended some great things based off my profile. I would definitely stay again. "
1037,39405,2666699,2012-10-20,3521310,Adam,Very cozy cottage. Would be 5 stars at $80/night. 
212764,28931478,532894111,2019-09-20,62394895,Adam,"Nice location, isn’t clear that this is a basement property. Owners/renters live upstairs and it’s very noisy in the basement unit."

He quickly responded when I had questions about the place or about places to visit and all his recommendations were amazing! We actually cooked meals during our stay and Matt had enough pots, pans, kitchen utensils, spices, etc for us to use. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider booking again!"

224229,31364596,552516309,2019-10-21,4870220,Liz,"This place was clean, comfortable, and safe. I was also concerned about the neighborhood once I (Hidden by Airbnb) mapped the address, but it's a quiet spot wedged in between other Federal buildings  and loft apartments, regardless of the Bail Bonds locations down the street. Parking was available, the building is locked in addition to the rooftop apartment. Listing is totally accurate, and we found it clean and comfortable. Lots of amenities are available in a small space, and the rooftop is a comfortable common space also. We booked to be close to the half marathon start and it was totally walkable from the capital and other places to see. It's the perfect place to book if you want to be downtown and don't plan to be in the apartment much."
107498,15746223,229452490,2018-01-23,7216344,Ryan,As stated above.

48866,7843605,260107031,2018-05-03,161752322,Russell,This was really a great stay for my friend and I who were finishing our week long road trip. This family provided great advice for the area and were also helpful throughout the process of the stay. All in all everything was beyond expected and would stay again if the opportunity arises.

22895,3742687,237344164,2018-02-22,163026675,Jacob,"Lucy was very friendly and we had a lovely chat when I first arrived. The house was really nice and she had an interesting array of curios dotted around, which made the house feel very homely.... I wish my own house was as homely feeling as Lucy’s! The bed was very comfy and I slept great. Location was excellent for my purposes. The houses in that part of the neighbourhood don’t actually front directly onto a street, which can make them slightly more difficult to find, but has the advantage of not having annoying vehicle noise from the street."

99305,14836832,415843110,2019-02-23,128224637,David,Great place with an amazing view overlooking LoDo. Necessities and attractions were all within walking distance or a short Uber lift. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting staying downtown.

We left the windows open at night and never had an issue with the noise in the neighborhood (very quiet and safe). Jeff made himself available, but stayed out of our way for the most part. He left lots of little touches like fancy soaps and snacks in the fridge. We had a fantastic time! Thanks, Jeff!"

202197,26816760,321969782,2018-09-11,96596505,Jessica,We had a great stay! I was very impressed with the basement. It had everything we needed and more. The bathroom was incredibly spacious with a shower and a jacuzzi tub. I liked how the bedrooms were spread apart and we had a living room. The couch also pulls out to a bed! I only have two recommendations: leave out a few trash bags because we could not find any and the pillows were too flat. Overall it was great in location and money!
89131,13657498,95034103,2016-08-18,89385875,Ebony,"My husband and I stayed one night at Jeff’s for a week-long trip in Colorado. If there was one thing we wished we could have changed on our trip, it would be not booking a longer stay with Jeff. The home is in a wonderful neighborhood. There were lots of folks riding their bikes and walking children. A true community feel. The room looked exactly how it was advertised, very clean and large…simply beautiful. Riley is the sweetest dog I’ve ever met! My husband and I did not feel like we were staying at a stranger’s.  Jeff engages with his guest  but also leaves you with plenty of privacy…the perfect balance!  Jeff offered to prepare meals for us, which was totally unexpected and very tasty.  We talked, we laughed and we ate!  I can’t stress how awesome our trip in Colorado was because of Jeff. We left his home feeling as if we simply visited a friend.

Even though I was familiar with the area, Heather sent a very helpful guide of local spots to eat and shop. Communication was very quick and efficient. 

Even though it is very close to I-25, it was surprisingly quiet and peaceful. Very easy to find with clear markings and easy entry. I’ll definitely come back!"

Better shampoo and beauty products than most which was nice! The place was a basement and hosts were very loud, very hard to relax up late and up early. Place was clean!"
89825,13746714,230030503,2018-01-26,167924403,William,"Since it was our first time using airbnb's services, we really didn't know what to expect. My daughter needed major surgery at a hospital nearby Paul's house, so the location was perfect. Paul immediately made us feel at home. To begin with, my daughter was in extreme pain because of the flight, and it was Paul that recognized this and offered her the use of his jet bathtub. Paul also took time to play some ping pong with my daughter which really helped her to keep her mind off of the upcoming surgery. There isn't enough room to tell all the wonderful things Paul did to make our stay so enjoyable so allow me to share a few. Paul was able to take us to several pre-op appointments which really helped us to apply resources to things like post-op medications and food. My daughter was really blessed when Paul took time out of his busy schedule to bring her an enchilada for lunch at the hospital.  We were pleasantly surprised to find out that Paul is a retired orthopedic surgeon. This was especially wonderful because he was able to help us make sense of the post-op pictures, x-ray's, and the recovery process. Also he was an incredible nurse which was very important when my daughter had a very high temperature upon returning back to the house. Paul was able to monitor the situation which really eased our fears. Finally, we can't begin to describe how warm and friendly Paul and the other graduate students were. We felt safe, and cared for, and it is for these reasons we give Paul our highest recommendation. You will never find a more affordable, elegant, and well maintained airbnb. Thanks for everything; Oh by the way, Jasmine says she's going to whoop you in ping pong so be ready."

I had no trouble finding my room, had access to her lovely backyard garden, and knew what was expected of me. Her welcome binder had many great suggestions for things to do and attractions to visit. The room was very comfortable and the bed was a dream cloud. I enjoyed meeting and chatting with Marisa and giving some extra scratches to Buddy. While my visit was short, I will remember my time with these consummate hosts. Truly fantastic experience. If I am in town again, I will definitely try to stay here or at least look Marisa up to visit again!"

They were flexible as to my check-in time and were able to lend me a couple of appliances I needed during my stay. The room where I stayed was cozy and comfortable. They graciously provided a continental-style breakfast with strawberries from their garden, and David very generously got up before dawn to drop me off at the bus that would take me back to the airport. This is a very friendly couple with a charming and relaxing place to stay. "

Very warm and inviting and a great place to return to after a day of exploring the city. Super easy check in, very comfortable bed, and a massive shower.

Ashley even invited me to a couple gatherings, but unfortunately I was too worn out to attend. I could not have felt more welcome! 

The house is nice, cozy, and accurately represented in the pictures. The bed was very comfortable, and the wifi was reliable. The location is fantastic. I walked everywhere, but there are city bikes for rent nearby too -- very convenient!  All in all, I highly recommend Ashley's place."

The place is charming, modern and extremely clean. The area (highlands) is perfect for anyone looking to explore Denver. There are many restaurants, shops and places to see in the area (by foot or car). Pizza Locale is a great little place close by if you are looking for Neapolitan pizza! There are many great Mexican restaurants close by as well, Liz sent us a welcoming packet with many great recommendations and we actually went to most of them on the list! The packet included many great activities close by and it was extremely helpful during our stay. She also includes brochures in the kitchen area which were great too! We will hopefully be back in the near future! "
103242,15271643,138338638,2017-03-19,65500245,Shawn,"I highly recommend booking this location, especially if you are wanting to be in the heart of all culture in Denver. There's so many places to go and see you'll feel guilty about just hanging out and enjoying the gorgeous view from the beautifully styled living room. David was very welcoming and offered to pick up a few things for me as he was going grocery shopping...hospitality and respecting privacy can be tricky to navigate, but my super busy schedule had me zipping in and out at all hours and not a peep because the room/bathroom are secluded enough that I felt like I was in a super fancy hotel suite which would've cost me the about of my three day stay for one night alone! "
77891,12622842,126669424,2017-01-13,48358500,David,Great place to stay. Manda is the best.

Hopefully everyone who visits gets the same great weather we had in early May! Would definitely recommend this rental to others.
81245,12990793,106890425,2016-10-08,56606018,Chris,"We loved our stay! Patricia's home was perfect for our first airb&b stay. Exactly like the pictures, plenty of privacy, the jetted tub was glorious, and apple TV a nice touch. Everything we needed and a great location. Less than 1.5 miles to EVERYTHING, or Uber was there in 2 minutes. Bed was a little snug coming from a King size at home. Highly recommended!"

I really appreciated Carly had a humidifier in the room, this helped a lot for me (coming from a very humid state to a dry one). I would stay there again!"

237138,34941908,526959359,2019-09-09,11511629,Nicole,"There aren’t any pics of the bathroom but it’s HUGE! There is a large stand up shower with a great shower head. The place was so clean! Very basic, no tv, but very fast internet. Beds kind of felt air mattress like, but the linens were great. Also, there were some adult beverages left for us, which was nice to have upon arrival. The location was STELLAR! So close to downtown! It would be especially great if you’re going to a football game. You could walk. However, it was tricky to find. It would have helped if we’d have been told it was behind another house on the street. I’m sure the front house people had fun watching us roam around their front yard, confused, through their GIANT picture window. I do wish there was a curtain to cover the sliding glass door for more privacy. The listing says 1.5 baths. I thought this meant it has like a full bath then another bathroom with just a toilet and sink. I guess it’s 1.5 just because of the size of the 1 shower. The responses were slow. I had to send a question 3 times before getting a response. Overall the location, price, and newness/cleanliness make it a great find."
121778,17240564,225224611,2018-01-05,68060575,Brianna,"Tommys place was a perfect fit for me and my fiancé while visiting Colorado. We wanted to experience all that CO had to offer and his place was almost an hour from everything outside of Denver, which is not bad at all considering the great mountainous scenery along the way. His house was very close to downtown which was nice when we went to explore Denver. Apart from the great location, tommys house was everything we needed; full kitchen bathroom, living room, dining area, and bedroom. Tommy was also a wonderful host in that he checked on us routinely to ensure that we had the best stay and was willing to go out of his way if we did need anything. Overall definitely a 5 star place.

74091,11713844,479988986,2019-07-01,8188063,Caitlin,"In general, quite tidy with good access to restaurants. The king-sized bed is a pull-out that makes the room quite challenging to move around in -- let alone open the door. So I wouldn't quite call it a bedroom."

The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was great (nice and clean big shower and double sinks, perfect for groups of 2). The space itself was a good size, and you have your own patio door straight to the backyard with a nice big hot tub. Overall, my boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely recommend to others!"

We had a private room and bathroom on a separate level of their home, with roof patio access to a gorgeous view of the city! We were within walking distance to all of the restaurants & breweries we wanted to visit downtown. Rebecca was very responsive to messages & an amazing host! They also have an adorable dog! Would definitely recommend!"

1339,39405,98915754,2016-09-02,7607318,Nicola,"The cottage was perfect.  Set back off the road behind a beautiful rustic garden. Everything in the cottage has been laid out perfectly to make as much use of the compact space as possible.  The cottage was immaculate, kitchen is well equipped, (not that we did any cooking as there is an awesome coffee shop around the corner and great burger/beer options), and Gio and Jennifer were great hosts. Easy to checkin and out and extremely helpful and welcoming while we were there."
157913,21343580,204558269,2017-10-18,21017873,Anastasia,"I admit, I was a little nervous about booking this place as I knew I would be the very guest. However, due to the great location and (what I could glean from the photos and space description) stylish decor, I decided to take a chance. I was blown away. 
Upon renting the space (which, btw the price is beyond reasonable for the value of this airbnb), I had a few questions to ask Zana about the amenities. She responded right away and was very helpful in answering my inquiries. Additionally, throughout the stay, she was easy to get ahold of and very accommodating of my questions and requests (I can be a pretty high maintenance guests sometimes...). She had a lot of recommendations of things to do and places to go as well as clear directions on how to access all of the parts of the house.
The space itself was very clean and I loved the interior design of it all--not at all kitschy or over the top the way a lot of airbnbs can be. It was a fairly large space, newly remodeled, with a great view. There were also some snacks for us to enjoy. The internet service was great and although Zana lived in the basement, we did not hear her or anyone else so it was very peaceful.
This has to be one of the best, if not THE best airbnb experiences I have ever had. I will definitely be staying again and I highly recommend it to anyone staying in the area. Thanks zana!"
100806,15022946,138632186,2017-03-20,15439042,Morgan,"We had an excellent stay! Check-in and communication were smooth and seamless, and made our arrival very easy. We arrived very early in the morning and they were kind enough to let us store our bags while we went out. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful, and there are so many things within a short walking distance. We walked and rode B-cycle bikes everywhere! The space itself was clean and comfortably furnished. We would definitely stay again."
243826,38582729,551990088,2019-10-20,14640946,Pam,Brand new townhome: designer sheets and towels!  Not to mention frig stocked with half/half and apples!  Fresh flowers and one block off DU campus. The best value we’ve experienced with Airbnb. We will never stay miles away or in dated hotels while visiting DU again. Definitely booking again
28647,4294257,329759690,2018-09-29,11347388,Ryan,"Travis’s place was conveniently located in Denver. Cool neighborhood with some great eateries and bars/breweries. Travis was a great host, always quick to reply to any questions we had, and gave us some great tips on places to go/things to do while we were there. Travis’s bathroom was also well stocked with things you might have forgotten at home (toothpaste, toothbrush, Q-tips, cotton make up removal pads). My only real complaints were that the bed was SUPER low to the ground and made getting in and out a bed a bit awkward day and the parking space was a bit tight. Other than that, this place couldn’t be beat."
186805,24379303,293610037,2018-07-20,83328747,Donnie,"Sherry’s place is s hidden gem in a great area.  The home is beautifully and thoughtfully remodeled to make your stay seamlessly effort free.   The kitchen is fully stocked for all of your needs, and the granite countertops are beautiful, giving it a rich luxurious feel.  There was always a parking spot in front of the house for easy parking.  The house is tucked back, but once inside its wide open and private.  I’ve added Sherry’s place to my favorites list when I’m in Denver.   It’s really a 5 star plus destination you won’t be disappointed... "
101639,15093485,154896833,2017-05-26,29595102,Katie,There was a group of nine of us and we all loved this place!

161447,21684780,426325428,2019-03-20,13166192,Noela,"We enjoyed our stay in this home. It was as described, aside from the location of the bathrooms. Bedrooms may be a bit close to share with teenage daughters, however we were happy with the set up of the home. Unfortunately, we were charged a different nightly rate from the listing, and our host never addressed our question about obtaining a refund for this discrepancy. Furthermore, we came back to the rental on our second afternoon to find a notice from the city posted to the front door, stating that the owner was in violation of city ordinances. Needless to say, this caused concern for both us, and the girls. The owner did not respond to our email about this issue, and we have yet to receive a refund for being overcharged."

The location makes it very easy to get any attraction in downtown Denver either by foot or a very short bus/uber ride. They are attentive to your needs, but also allow you to enjoy your vacation at a distance as if it was your own home."

I hope to stay with them again on one of my next trips to Denver. "
40217,6471872,483594354,2019-07-07,13633005,Jacqueline,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

This house is absolutely incredible—location is amazing and close to everything but on a quiet residential street so it was silent at night even with windows open. The decor is gorgeous—you’ll want to redecorate your whole house after staying in this beauty  Everything was clean and lovely. The beds were all very comfy, the swamp cooler/AC kept us cool enough and two large bathrooms made it easy for 6  women to get ready all at once. Megan was super prompt with responses and was very accommodating about checking in early and checking out late/storing bags. The natural light is incredible, the sonos speakers were so clutch and we were able to park find street parking every day right outside.

214576,29259757,545159502,2019-10-11,81128429,Jordan,"Our group of 4 had a great stay at Richard’s place. The space is really nice and the beds are comfy. Excellent communication from the hosts. There are neighbors above and adjacent, and the floors are a little squeaky, but it wasn’t a problem for us. The location is great, close to restaurants, coffee shops, and a beautiful lake/park - and only a short drive to the downtown area. The garage space really came in handy, as it snowed during our stay. We would definitely stay here again!"

98094,14741480,534496174,2019-09-22,20557237,Tommy,"We had a fantastic stay at Carolyn's. The house itself was lovely, comfortable, and well equipped. She was a great host and was very hospitable. My only note is that while the neighborhood is lovely and quiet, there isn't much within walking distance (< 1mi). If you don't have a car, you will be using Uber/Lyft/a bike to get anywhere. It's a trade off between being in a more active area or having a quieter neighborhood. There is a cute little cafe a 10min walk away though!"
219058,29967439,562434193,2019-11-10,8511699,Deidre,Great location and a lovely host. I would recommend Krista’s place to anyone looking to access Denver and all it has to offer.

I believe the location is fairly central as I saw public trains passing by (we mainly took lyft).  We were unsure of the neighborhood, but in general, we couldn't really figure that out anywhere in Denver."

The guest house is even more beautiful in person. I very soon felt right at home. They supply you with the basics: towels, soap, toothpaste, etc. They also supply a ""Welcome Manual"" which enlists all the things you need to know about their home and city. Inside are some recommendations, from food to shopping and even dispensaries. They are 420 friendly, all they ask is that you smoke outside where they have a small table and chair set up for you. My stay was perfect from beginning to end. When we do go back to visit Denver I will be reserving my stay at Shelby's. Enjoy."
155733,21177615,269003977,2018-05-26,142879934,Steven,Amazing location for anyone looking for a place just on the edge of downtown with plenty of local bars and restaurants nearby.

There is a dog yes... if you can find him. He never went upstears and did not bark even once. I would literally call for him to pet him but he is really shy and he would hide. The Yale station is near, there is a bus line.. you cant go wrong with this one."

Steve is indeed a “super host”!  He took time with us when we arrived and went well above and beyond with our requests.  Thank you again, Steve!

We will be recommending this little house as a place away from home to our friends!"

The house gets a little warm during high temperatures, but opening a couple windows and turning the fans/window unit on does the trick. Bradley was very efficient in responding to my questions and very helpful. Would recommend and stay here again!"

Auch ohne Auto ist das Quartier gut geeignet, per Bus ist man in wenigen Minuten in der Downtown und auch die Anbindung zum Flughafen ist gut."

The apartment is super clean and looks great. Perfect place to stay for a couple of nights in Denver!"

90986,13789731,170096988,2017-07-14,8818749,Dan,"The space is huge and pretty comfortable. It's a little quirky as one of the bathroom doors doesn't lock, one of the bedrooms only has a curtain and no door, but it's a comfy and large apartment. This isn't a place that people live it seems, just for AirBnB guests so the kitchen is pretty empty and there aren't much more than bare necessities so if you like to cook you'll want to bring your own. There were towels and soaps and that sort of thing, no problems there. The place was very clean and the neighborhood was pretty. We were reminded to clean up before we left which I'm sure is par for the course for a place that only hosts AirBnB guests but given there is a non-small cleaning fee, I thought it was a little unnecessary but not a big deal or anything. I asked a few questions via text of our host which weren't important but two of which didn't receive a response so communication wasn't great but not terrible or anything. Not a bad place to stay at all, and a good neighborhood, but wanted to mention some of these quirks which could be useful for certain guests to know about. "

The beds & couches are exactly what we needed after long days hiking & exploring Denver, Boulder, & Red Rocks. You'll find the kitchen nicely stocked with cooking essentials should you want to prepare a meal. The back yard has so much privacy & delightful crickets it'll make you feel like you're far from the city.  The neighborhood is amazing. Can't wait to return to Denver again & find this home available for our stay. Thank you Jessica for your great hospitality!"

We chose the location for a concert at Red Rocks.  This place was a 5 min walk to a great coffee shop and a 10 min walk to Illegal Pete’s to catch a bus to the concert.  (The bus drops you off at North lot - top of venue, so plan on get tickets rows 50 or up. )   Great Airbnb - Great trip!"
159313,21463028,507436762,2019-08-11,65740679,Jennifer,"Great place, super clean, and really close to down town. The library had a huge selection of really great, eclectic books. Bathrooms were great and there was plenty of room for all of us. The loft does get hot in the summer, but there was a fan provided. The kids we put up there didn't seem to care.

While it said that it was able to be booked for 10 people, we did run into problems with not having enough supplies for such a large group - specifically towels, silverware, and coffee cups. That being said, the kitchen was generally well stocked with cooking and serving supplies. 

We chose this place due to its location and the fact it had an electric car charger. The charger worked great and it was so easy to park on the pad in the alley. 

I would definitely stay here again if we wanted to be close to downtown."

134842,18996370,195277514,2017-09-18,97470723,Ron,"I'm new to Airbnb and when I saw ""entire home/apt"" I thought I was renting a HOUSE or an entire apartment. It's actually a basement converted to living quarters. While it's tastefully done, I could hear the tenants upstairs in the main house the whole time--I didn't have the solitude I thought I was getting. Host Travis was responsive and compassionate about my disappointment, but just be aware you'll have neighbors on the floor above you and will hear their footsteps through the ceiling."
142343,19893591,182491798,2017-08-14,26991675,Emily,"Lee and Shannon's place was cozy and comfortable. These hosts have thought through every last detail, and they were very thorough in their communication. Would definitely recommend and stay again!"

56808,8800911,405828962,2019-01-27,173133179,Twee,"When we arrived to this gorgeous converted church on the corner of a cute neighborhood in Denver we loved the experience of opening the wrought iron gates, walking up a dozen or so stairs to then open a humble doorway into a very grand and magnificent open concept converted loft. What a divine experience to walk across, around, and through such a massive space so beautifully decorated with such simplicity and modern elegance....a palatial retreat within the city! We only stayed two nights.....too short. The mattresses were pure heaven! (And that comes from a friend healing from hip issues). Note to Light Sleepers: If you’re a light sleeper, bring ear plugs as it is a loft which means lots and lots of open air spaces for bedrooms and bathrooms. If you need total quiet, perhaps take the room inside the tiny house (which is just off the living space). The rest of the beds are in rooms that have cool portals or no walls that allow sound to flow through easily. It was Divine!"
44382,7205120,124312143,2017-01-01,11400294,Kyle,Nadine was amazing and super hospitable. The place was exactly as listed and was in the perfect location to easily navigate around Denver. Will definitely stay again!!!

The space was very clean, beautiful, inviting and made for the perfect weekend get away.

119151,16913376,291945178,2018-07-16,105962491,Danielle,We had a great time.  The house was very clean. Views from the deck were amazing.

48955,7843605,413548850,2019-02-17,60869450,Chris,"Cynthia was great! Checking was a breeze. Having the parking spot was very helpful. Be mindful about their note about being being upstairs. There is noise, and if that is going to bother you, this is NOT the place for you!"
24362,3968613,296404133,2018-07-25,4069087,Taylor,Erika is awesome & her place is lovely. I hope to come back to see more of the area. She gave me a very thorough walkthrough when I arrived along with some great local tips. Would definitely book again!
107146,15674169,457221160,2019-05-23,24675982,Becca,Alex’s house was amazing and beautiful. It had great amenities and an awesome bathroom. The location was perfect.
70871,11191271,64132850,2016-02-29,44540295,Patrick,"This place was perfect for our weekend trip to Denver. Close to everything and probably the most comfortable bed in denver.

I encourage everyone check it out.

Owner was helpful and always quick to response.

Very very happy we stayed here.

Cheers!"
161187,21667826,327244541,2018-09-23,50782880,Allison,"Simon and Aurora are really above and beyond hosts. The place was perfectly clean, tastefully decorated and filled with all the extras (including a coffee bar and a 6 pack of local beer in the fridge). Its the best of both worlds with the amenities and privacy of a hotel and the little touches that make you feel right at home. The location is great, about 20 minute walk to the RiNo area (we walked several times to breakfast and a wedding we were visiting for). Definitely recommend their carriage house to anyone visiting Denver!"
233200,33664011,484400331,2019-07-08,255981441,Denise,"Great house! You really don’t need to bring anything but your clothing and toothbrush. House clean, and so beautiful. The host Rich was great. Will pass on to my friends. Loved our whole trip! So much room."
228637,32360723,428215849,2019-03-24,236933967,Cassandra,Amazing! In the middle of many destinations and not far from the airport! Cutest little house with special touches!
157128,21264389,262412343,2018-05-08,118715381,Just-In,There's really no competition. For the price and location alone the rooms a steal. I didnt see Wajdi too much but he was awesome the brief moments we did connect. Once you get the key its like having an apartment almost to yourself.
172968,22884861,233711969,2018-02-10,18165343,Nikita,"Chris was a great host, everything was as advertised and the location could not have been better. Checkin was a breeze, and the apartment was very comfy and warm."
152012,20996662,275790714,2018-06-11,181106601,Jazmin,"Cameron’s place was perfect! It was like home away from home. Walking distance to soooo many restaurants and nightlife or a quick drive away. Friendly neighbors and community.

Cameron also allowed us to check in earlier, which helped us because we got into town pretty early. His guide was also perfect to get around. 

We hope to return in the winter, and crossing our fingers that his place will be available."
106567,15589617,305704733,2018-08-11,27524274,Nancy,Becky was there to check us in and was very welcoming. Her location is great for a family. It’s close to restaurants and Washington Park. The fenced backyard was perfect for our 17 month old grandson. The house was very clean and in a safe neighborhood. We would stay there again. 
232094,33373336,459743389,2019-05-27,247126194,Todd,Great place very clean very nice host quick response
114142,16312814,208714366,2017-11-02,43904063,Amy,"Jack's place is exactly as advertised....clean, spacious and comfortable. Has everything you need if you dont want to cook and just want to be in and out to sleep, Jack's place is perfect! The bed is super comfortable and the room is nice and dark and quiet for sleep. The bathroom is brand new and the shower is great! Jack was very responsive...he checked in with us daily and was very kind and helpful. He also picked us up at the airport for $20. He was a pleasure to work with! I'd definitely stay at his place again!"
231734,33341740,477170893,2019-06-27,251096204,Harrison,A Great Spot with Great Hosts! The rooftop is awesome! Next time I am in Denver I know where I want to stay!
121273,17175148,474005665,2019-06-22,81558300,Carone,"The place is just as good, if not better,  in real life as it is in pictures. The four of us had lots of room to comfortably spread out. The location is a quick walk or Uber to a variety of places. I appreciate that there were two gated parking spots so we could leave our cars and not worry about them.  We would absolutely recommend staying there!"
217515,29655836,424432328,2019-03-16,11784645,Shanthi,"The best part of this place was the location--right in the middle of lots of great things to do! Beds were very comfortable, overall a good experience."
25397,4067759,27028422,2015-02-23,25442882,Nick,"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Erika's. My room was clean, spacious, and thoughtfully decorated. The neighborhood was great, too. There's authentic Mexican food and an inviting coffee shop well within walking distance. I would definitely stay here the next time I'm in Denver."
18119,2817786,39159997,2015-07-21,27657151,Donita,"Couldn't have been a better experience.  Mary was so personable and helpful, made me feel right at home.  The house was lovely, kitchen magnificent, bedroom and bathroom were beautiful, clean, modern, and comfortable.   Lucy, the cat, liked me, even if she tried to play hard-to-please sometimes :-)  I loved the neighborhood, walking distance to practically anything you want, loved sitting on the back patio relaxing.  I definitely plan on returning to Mary's house on my next trip to Denver!"
197418,26130724,414475851,2019-02-19,110897864,Dartan,"Amazing location, with a rustic homie feeling. Would recommend to anyone!"
32347,4951295,340342561,2018-10-23,73446071,Rachelle,"The Nest was perfect for our long weekend trip to Denver! It was very quaint, had everything we needed and then some, and was in a great location. We were able to walk to several places, Uber was easily accessible, and parking wasn't too bad. In the evenings it was a little harder to find a spot right in front of the house, but we never had to park on a different block. Gretchen was fantastic and sent us a list of restaurants to check out, all of which we did were delicious! We would definitely recommend and would stay at the Nest again. With it being an older house, you can hear the dogs walking upstairs sometimes. And we could hear the house sitters talking/laughing while we were there in the evenings, but it wasn't so loud we couldn't fall or stay asleep. It didn't bother us but would be something to think about if you are a very light sleeper."
194117,25459427,550866458,2019-10-19,39080781,Lot,"Very nice, updated, cool, open, clean and comfortable place. It was the first private residence I've ever seen with a Japanese -style toilet which was awesome! The owner composts, recycles and uses solar panels for energy source which are all great for the environment. She was also very easy and available to communicate with. The comfy bed and pillows, cool temperature in the bedroom and quiet neighborhood made the place perfect for a good night sleep. It was well stocked with towels, sheets and even toiletries if you need them. The kitchen had a filtered water dispenser so you can fill your water bottles which you'll definitely want to do in Denver!"
155883,21177882,307101388,2018-08-13,58532022,Kevin,Good Central location.

Easy check in and in a convenient location with a few little restaurants just on the corner! A bit warm in the living room with no AC, but with fan use, we managed :) Thanks Brittany!"
122090,17251698,269703189,2018-05-27,80365747,Ally,We enjoyed our stay at Michael and Connie's place. Check in was very simple and Michael was great at providing local tips. The room was perfect and in a good location.
115281,16406440,422214912,2019-03-10,7248481,Peter,Wonderful house with a fabulous backyard patio. Hosts were very communicative and check-in was a breeze. Would certainly stay there again.

170329,22515364,479949567,2019-07-01,78710440,Eliza,"The Artisan's loft was definitely one of my favorite Airbnbs to date. From the convenient location in trendy RiNo (20ish mins to the airport, 10 mins to downtown, less than a 5 min walk to the light rail/bus, in walking distance to several breweries and great restaurants) to the thoughtful touches and amenities throughout the space, everything about our stay was perfect. My only regret is that we didn't get to spend more time there!  Would definitely recommend the loft to anyone wanting to stay in a unique home in a fun neighborhood."
234200,33941538,551967333,2019-10-20,32220193,Maureen,"Catherine and Ryan's two bedroom suite is located at the front part of their residence but is completely separate (including separate entrance) so guests can come and go without disturbing them. The house itself sits on a tree-lined and well maintained street, amid a neighborhood of beautiful homes. Street parking in front of the house was plentiful. Communication and check-in were a breeze. The space is large, clean and very well appointed. We loved the Casper mattress and were extremely comfortable in the unit. The surrounding neighborhood has a nearby grocery store, Starbucks and various restaurants. We had a wonderful visit with my daughter who just relocated to Denver and would absolutely love to stay here again! Thank you Catherine and Ryan!"
183742,24058066,479210709,2019-06-30,81891917,Dan,Great place with a great location. This place had everything we needed for a weekend getaway of 10+ guests. The location is great with free parking on the street and about a fifteen minute walk to the rino neighborhood where we spent most of our free time outside of the house. I'm a sucker for a front porch and this one does not fall short.
38589,6333040,54094119,2015-11-16,41573728,Serge,I loved the place!!!  Mick was a great host and will definitely come back.

71132,11192056,292742480,2018-07-18,52713572,Bruce,Kinga’s place is special. We had our adult daughter and boyfriend with us and the space worked well. It was comfortable and thoughtfully appointed. It was clean and cared for. The shower was great. The beds were comfortable. We loved the rooftop deck looking out over the City. Great place for some wine and conversation. We loved Kinga’s lounge-late night perogis and wings saved us after a late concert in Boulder. The infused pepperoncini polish vodka was to die for. Our son lives in Cap Hill so the location was perfect for us. We had 5 great nights at Kinga’s and will return..
4569,662390,91870452,2016-08-07,146317,Stanley,"Steve and Vicky were wonderful hosts! Super helpful with information, they made us feel welcome in their beautiful home. Accommodations are spacious and very comfortable. The modern, impeccably clean bath was just outside our room and we had it all to ourselves. The neighborhood has lovely homes with character, friendly people, unique cafes and restaurants, and train to downtown Denver within easy walking distance. 
When rain/cold was forcast for the evening we were going to a concert at Red Rock, Steve went above and beyond, loaning us rain gear, warm jackets and a backpack, saving the day! "
130081,18396744,244855289,2018-03-19,25768803,Kirsten,Tim's place was just as described and a great place to stay. Easy walking distance to/from the train and many places to grab food and a drink. Tim let us check in early and was very friendly. Would recommend to anyone staying in Denver!

765,592,5095934,2013-06-11,6806537,Samuel,"Jill's hospitality was more selfless than I could have expected. She was out of town so I did not have the chance to meet her, but the fact that she trusted me to stay and care for her home alone spoke volumes of her personality as well as kindness. I would not hesitate to stay here again. "
167630,22264680,265327993,2018-05-16,1795849,Kevin,"We really enjoyed this beautiful property. It was perfect for our big family. 

The location was amazing as it was only a quick drive to downtown Denver and grocery stores and restaurants (great free parking options as well).

The property was also very clean and had all of the amenities a big group would need. We didn't have much need for local tour tips but knew they were there if we needed them.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Denver and would stay here again in a heartbeat."

10368,1189999,6115639,2013-07-30,5492353,Nora,What a great find!  We loved our stay in Mike's Apt. and had everything we needed.  I was worried there would not be much light since it's a basement but it was filled with light.  Every room had large windows that looked onto the garden and backyard (the bathroom's windows were covered by a screen that hid the washer and dryer).  Another concern I had going in was hearing noise from upstairs but we didn't hear a thing.  The place was new and pristine and the beds were very comfortable.  You can tell Mike has worked very hard making this apt. fantastic.  All my expectations were exceeded and I highly recommend this perfect spot.

Booking was easy and as my reservation approached, he sent me a very detailed message outlining the check-in process, things to know, suggestions to eat/do, etc. The bnb is very clean, stylish and new. It had so many amenities and thoughtful touches. The washer/dryer was clutch. I appreciated the hair dryer, straightener, bluetooth speaker, fan next to the bed, etc. It all came handy when we needed it. He also left us a bottle of wine for us to enjoy :) The location is perfect, we were able to walk to Civic Center Park to watch fireworks as well as downtown Denver to explore/eat. It was about a 10-15 min walk. The bike share kiosk was right outside the door; we used it once to get home from sightseeing. Allan really made it feel like home and we couldn't be happier. I highly highly recommend this place! Perfect for me and my husband."

Jenica was very nice, quick to respond, and an awesome host. She even tried to help us track down a lost personal item. I'd definitely stay here again. "

My girlfriend and I loved the layout and style of the guesthouse. Couldn’t have asked for better hosts, they did everything to ensure our comfort and even had a bottle of wine waiting for us at check-in. I definitely plan on staying here again when I an back in town."

38275,6185753,268055403,2018-05-23,181475794,Derek,Candace’s place was very clean and well thought out. The location is perfect and there is a grocery store only one block away.  She left us very simple and informative instructions that not only had the rules but also nearby places of interest. Very easy to check in and out with the lock box. She let us use her washer and dryer and was easy to access as well. In our 3-day stay we never got to officially meet Candace but this only added to the privacy we enjoyed at her place. Perfect for people who like to cook and or relax and watch cable tv. Overall a great stay and great value.

Great place, thanks for letting us stay."

They definitely left the best impression on us! It was great to have a personal touch and communication, and the space felt extremely private being in the basement with a private bathroom. The neighborhood this unit is located in is also extremely lovely with lots of restaurant choices nearby. Would definitely stay again!"

There was a super convenient grocery store below the apartment. 16th street mall was a short walk away. The condo is a good central location and most neighborhoods were just a short car ride away. Carrie was flexible with our check out time and gave us access to laundry! The private bedroom and bathroom worked well for our needs. We loved spending some time on the patio, taking in the beautiful mountain views."

The queen bed is very comfortable and the bedroom has all you can need.

Jill was a charming host and very prompt in communicating. Lots of local spots to enjoy, including cute coffee shops and a grocery store immediately across the street. The only caveat is that street parking can be tight—we arrived late the first evening and it was a challenge to find a spot. Earlier in the day there was no problem. Altogether, highly recommended!"

I could list off everything about this place to help you with your decision, but I’m going to stop here and just say if you’re search has brought you to this home - stop your search and book a room. This is where you want to be! And also, if you see a scooter... RIDE IT!!"

He provided water, coffee and creamer, a fully stocked kitchen and toiletries which were all thoughtful touches!  he was very responsive ahead of time and provided a large list of his recommendations for places to enjoy while we were in and around Denver. We were able to walk to Safeway to get a few groceries, found parking right in front of his home, and easily obtained uber rides downtown for around $8-15.  It was rather hot while we were there and there are only window AC units so just something to be aware of during peak summer if you are not a fan of the heat. But overall we had a wonderful experience staying at Tim’s and would definitely recommend it!"

153571,21042587,422311976,2019-03-10,32158086,Adriene,"Matt’s place was great! Our family just needed a place for one night before heading into the mountains for a ski trip the next day. The location was close to everything we needed. His place was clean and nicely decorated, and I have to say the beds made our stay just as comfortable as if we were at our own home. The other great thing about Matt’s place was the patio! When we arrived Matt told us that the fire pit wasn’t working, but he was insistent on getting it to work for our stay. Ended up that he couldn’t get it to work so he went a bought a brand new one and had it installed that same night. 
One last mention of appreciation is that our furry family member was welcome too! Wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again. It was perfect for our family of six! Thanks Matt! You were an excellent host!"
179219,23596506,439725406,2019-04-19,55841100,Pauline,This is a great place to stay with kids.  There is a park right across the street. The room sizes are perfect. We had a great time in Denver!
133297,18811589,402800870,2019-01-19,14866548,Matt,"Great place!  I stayed for two weeks and the value, comfort, and hospitality were outstanding.  Would stay again."

8655,875596,24247228,2014-12-23,6238594,Claudia,"Very easy process with the host and great meeting his property manager, Brittaney, who was super friendly and helpful in getting us setup in the house. 
The house is super cute and cozy and we totally enjoyed the front porch with the rocking chairs and the beautiful yard out back. I loved the collection of old cameras in the living room!
The location is quiet and convenient if you have a car...we  will totally be back to stay here again anytime we come back to Denver!"
22822,3742687,145292817,2017-04-17,101767858,Toni,Lucy's place is so sweet and very comfortable. I will definitely stay there again !

201249,26607884,448945839,2019-05-05,135998582,Marais,"This is an awesome space. It's super cute and stylish, and Eric even put out a bottle of yummy wine for us upon arrival! The location is excellent -- close to several awesome restaurants, bars, brunch spots, dispensaries, even quirky little boutiques. We ran out of time to try Eric's wife's yoga class, but that's a super awesome perk, too! :)"
230156,32809138,533422930,2019-09-21,46298961,Johnny,Easy to check in. Everything was set up well. Would recommend again.

136994,19245891,317767504,2018-09-02,18508827,Jennifer,"My fiance and I booked a quick trip to Denver for my birthday/hiking RMNP. We took a Lyft rather than the train from the airport to Vicky's.
From the get-go, communication was quick and easy with Vicky. We were getting in late, so she made sure to leave a light on for us inside and out.
Vicky's house is comfortable and welcoming. The kitchen is gorgeous and full of amenities that we didn't use, but were grateful they were available. We loved being able to grind fresh coffee every morning, and then head out to the beautiful covered back patio to sip in silence. (We're from NYC - the silence in this neighborhood was golden!)
We felt safe in the neighborhood, and we were able to easily walk to King Sooper (grocery store through Kroeger)."
109814,15846078,138805763,2017-03-21,72856382,Tamiko,Place was great. Tama has two dogs and two cats who became family straight away. May look intimidating at first but they are crazy friendly and my boyfriend and I had a great time playing with them. Tama is really easy going and happy to help. Great place!
158912,21435378,560412143,2019-11-06,10421744,Samantha,"Gorgeous modern house that's a short walk from transit / a hip area of denver. Will definitely look to stay here again! Also, I really appreciate how flexible and responsive the host was with me when arranging my travel plans"
84501,13207841,90596184,2016-08-01,1153907,Courtney,"Top notch experience at Emily's place. Adorable little house with plenty of room for me and a couple friends (couch easily accommodated the extra person). The neighborhood was perfect: tree lined streets and quiet but walkable to tons of local shops, bars and restaurants (or a quick uber downtown). Emily's communication was great, she made us feel very welcome and provided a very clean, well-appointed place for our weekend in Denver. "
110773,16026347,281808765,2018-06-25,6090953,Jon,"Very cozy, fun location, hosts are generous and responsive"
181327,23769761,462091614,2019-06-01,327763,Jennifer,"Carol's place is beautiful! The rooftop deck is a special treat with a great view. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay close to downtown. Our group was in for a work conference and some fun during downtime. It was great to have a kitchen, living room and separate bedrooms/baths instead of sharing a hotel room. 

Two things to note about this AirBnb: 1) The bathroom on the 2nd floor is a half-bath that is in the kitchen/living area. Guests staying in the 2nd floor bedroom will need to go up to the 3rd floor to shower in one of the private bathrooms/accessible only by entering the bedrooms on this level. 2) Clearer check-in instructions are needed. I gave the host suggested check-in instructions for future renters. Carol is super responsive and checks in often with her guests so I am sure this won't be an issue for future renters."
217767,29680386,548470389,2019-10-17,154681004,Michael,Connie cares about your AirBnB experience. It showes with everything she does to prepare for your stay.

82938,13081152,289623160,2018-07-12,4967850,Jordan,"Mitchell made check in simple and easy. The room is nothing fancy but has everything I needed. During the hot July days, the ceiling fan did a good job of quickly cooling the room. The room is 2 blocks away to many good breweries. It’s about a 20 minute walk to 16th street mall and downtown Denver. Good budget option!"
194773,25540293,484366058,2019-07-08,118429596,Vicky,"Sydney and Frank are such warm and nice people. Sydney was amazing from prior to booking through checkout. She answered all of my questions and was so quick to respond.  She left a bottle of wine as well as a note welcoming us to Denver. The apartment is IMMACULATE!! It even smelled amazing! There were so many additional inclusions, like a humidifier, that I would never have thought to include as a host. I honestly couldn’t ask for anything else. We had no complaints whatsoever. The location is great! Very walkable and lots to do and restaurants to go to within walking distance. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
5247,665622,101594923,2016-09-14,11156780,Beth,"This is such a great place to stay in Denver!  The location is amazing - you can walk downtown easily, and so much good food nearby.

242180,37590420,548040770,2019-10-16,9153199,Kate,"This is a brand new place with beautiful views of the mountains. It’s a great location and a reasonable price. The hosts are responsive and check-in and communication was easy/good. Make sure to bring good earplugs as the road noise is loud and as the hosts transparently say in the posting (thank you hosts!), this unit is adjoined to the main family house so you can hear the family talking, TV, dog etc. The set-up inside is basic but clean; amazing couch in the living area and gorgeous views."
109362,15831072,144369931,2017-04-15,114339136,Adrienne,We really enjoyed our stay in Denver. Kelsey's place is in a great location and is a short walk or uber ride to many attractions!

Would absolutely book again if I’m ever in Denver again, it’s right by the train station and I wish I hadn’t rented a car."

144266,20211196,514746204,2019-08-21,189351732,Brittani,"It is really well located to downtown, better than I could have expected! Voodoo doughnuts is near by and would say go there! Also, a Safeway is well located. 

The photos do not do the place justice, there is more space than one would expect as the bathroom is really spacious. The heated floors are a nice touch I bet during more colder months.

I would stay here again if I come back to Denver! "

Her beautiful home in the LoHi neighborhood was exactly what we were looking for - a modest, comfortable and clean house to sleep. The house itself is also in a nice neighborhood, with plenty to walk to (food, beer and coffee) and accessible to downtown. 

Krista herself provided a lot of great suggestions for things to do and try in the area. We were especially appreciative of her knowledge of everything local since she's a native Coloradan - she had a unique perspective.

Hope we'll visit again some day!"

The neighborhood feels very safe. The beds were very comfortable and the amenities such as coffee and soap to wash and everything you need to cook was just the best. I would book immediately!  You do have to walk downstairs to access the space so keep that in mind, but the stairway has a light and rail. 

Great space and our guest were talking about renting it again. Really happy I booked it"
58170,9009513,99779249,2016-09-05,68055419,Kelsey,"Our stay in Denver could not have been more comfortable. Katie and Patrick have a beautiful space in the downstairs portion of their home, all which can be accessed through a private entrance! This was perfect as there were times where we needed to be up early or came back late, and we did not need to disturb anybody. The space was clean and had everything we needed plus a few extras to make our stay even better. An informative note was left for us as well, informing us of the space as well as their contact information should any needs arise. What's more is that the home is located in a neighborhood close to many restaurants as well as near downtown Denver. We didn't need to travel far to have fun. Would highly recommend this space to anyone, and we would gladly stay there again any time!"
179587,23617474,351398342,2018-11-22,687589,Nizam,"//Great Location for groceries:
1. Block from Wholefoods.  Recommend the squash and ricotta pizza.  Also recommend you get a can of the La Colombo Draft Latte. 

//Great Location for Artisan Coffee: 
1. Walk to new Huckleberry Roaster location near Coors Park.  I recommend trying the Cortado and the Pour Over (Ask for Ardi beans )

2. Walk to Little Owl and try their Cortado

3. Walk to Union Station to Mercantile and try their Cappuccino.  After trying the Capp, buy a bag of the Commonwealth Ontology coffee beans to go.  If you don’t have an espresso machine at home, Buy one. I recommend the Breville or the Luccca M58 (advanced users )

//Desserts:
1.  Walk to Littleman Ice Cream and eat your cone across the street at the park 
2. Walk to Denver Market Place and order a Flight ice cream (1.2 miles away)

//Food
1.  You have to walk or Uber to Root Down 
2.  Linger is also great 
3. Breakfast? You must try Snooze and order the Good Benny 

The Airbnb by Guest Stars is a great launching pad for all the above 

//For Free
1.  Hang out at Platte river and listen to the water
2. Walk to Highlands with a present state of mind
3. Must visit Tattered Cover Books and browse books you normally wouldn’t grab ...
4. Smile at others"

I didn’t  care for the walk into town on my own, so I used Lyft to get around.  Had a water incident, but was quickly informed about how to handle it.  Great communication."
4801,662431,463658691,2019-06-03,81319282,Mark,"A travel buddy and I decided mid-road trip to splurge on a quick one-night stopover in Denver. Tim's studio fit the bill perfectly with a hot shower, clean towels, comfortable bed (and lounger) -- all in the gorgeous neighborhood of Washington Park. We really enjoyed our walk to breakfast on S Gaylord St in the morning. 

Check-in/check-out were both a breeze. As noted in the description, there were some moments where the kids upstairs were not exactly *quiet* around dinnertime, but things settled down within a perfectly reasonable amount of time. 

One thing to be aware of - leaves/dirt blowing in from the front door! We kept a shoes-off-at-the-door policy and that helped keep it clean. Overall 10/10 recommend!"
125717,17664945,416641234,2019-02-24,189104429,Margie,Our stay was fantastic!  Randall even accommodated a last minute request for our son to stay over.  It was perfect!

231984,33365990,498345084,2019-07-29,268516047,Tyler,"Enjoyable little spot in East Colfax, a little bit away from downtown Denver, but the bus system was easy to figure out. But very close to very fun neighborhoods and enjoyable dining and activities."
106871,15641776,255459485,2018-04-20,131824914,Peter,Mike is a great host and have taken care of the fine details are Home. He had chilled beer and snacks available in case the wearing guests need it. Rooms are small but living room and kitchen are sizeable. Locations is great for the convention center which is less than 10 mins walk.
109216,15817834,368380466,2019-01-06,123436684,Anke,"Ashleys AirBnB was more than we expected. Its really large and has a big, nice bathroom as well as some cooking facilities to cook warm meals. The Apartment is bigger than i expected it will be. The Bed was so nice, comfy and great. Her communication was easy, quick and she gave us lot of information and made sure that we were able to find the house and get into it. Its perfect place to stay for a couple of days, its close to the downtown and in a save and quite neighborhood. Can highly recommend it!"

195767,25735707,454642617,2019-05-18,173076,Kari Jo,"The hosts went out of the way to make sure we were taken care of, plenty of recommendations, and also very thorough with information needed to stay at the home. The place is clean and comfortable with a relaxing yard out back. The dogs Maggie and Rupert were very sweet and ultra adorable. Extra perk to watch streaming services - especially if you go to Casa Bonita and need to watch the South Park episode shortly after. Great area to stay in as well. My bf and I were happy to have stayed there and to visit with them both! Thank you!"
106180,15551405,173635244,2017-07-23,136129529,Brenda,"This was our first trip to Denver. The overall location was great, not too far from major destinations. The check in/out process was easy, the host was kind enough to extend our check out time until 12pm for an extra $25 which helped us with our flight time. The home was quaint, the ac was not working during our visit and we were not informed until we arrived at the location. Being from Texas we completely understand that bugs tend to come out during the summer however we did have a few spider issues. Overall good experience!"

Only ate out once for drinks and appetizers since our sons live in the area and we have been there many times. Good location for first time visitors or even seasoned Denverites needing a nice place to just getaway. Might even book for next Christmas.
2298,98008,3126340,2012-12-20,161730,Trucy,"I stayed one night when Jim was away on a ski trip and had the whole house to myself. My room was great for the type of stay I wanted: cozy, comfortable bed for reading a book and watching TV shows on my laptop, and lots of sunlight for waking up in the morning. The house was beautifully furnished and decorated, and everything was very clean, I recommend!"

The hosts had great recommendations and were very attentive as well as helpful when explaining how the altitude of Denver effects people. 

It was in a great location, could get to anything we needed in a short Uber or a short walk. Loved how communal the space was - past residence left herbs behind to share and we did the same. It was a great time. We did have to keep quiet after dark because the host lives above the space but it is not an inconvenience for how amazing the space is! Safe neighborhood and great recommendations from the hosts! Definitely my go to place next time I’m in Denver!"

East Colfax has plenty to see and do, especially if you like to walk. I spent time at a variety of coffee shops, and restaurants/bars; but, I most enjoyed visiting a shop called Spirit Ways, and reading one afternoon away at Tattered Cover bookstore. 

Kate is also very near City Park, which has seemingly endless walking paths, a lake to sit by, a science museum, and a zoo. The botanical gardens are a short drive from her place and are definitely worth a visit. 

Thank you to Kate for the advice she gave about where to go and what to see and do. Made for a wonderful and reflective solo-trip!"

I was in town for a work event that was around the corner, so the location could not have been more perfect.

Before my arrival Mike kept me updated and welcomed me  with answers to questions. When I arrived the place was super clean, great decor,  and space was as stated on the site. 

I would stay at Mikes'  place again in a heartbeat. I highly recommend this Airbnb in Denver for conference attendees, weekend visitors, students, professionals, and really anyone."

Her dog and cat always came down to hang out and my children loved them laying on their laps. Great location-blocks from City Park, the Zoo, and Park Hill has some great restaurants. The hip places on Colfax are a little over a mile away. Best stay ever!"
115759,16522375,262691476,2018-05-09,60765677,Wade,"Emma is a terrific host!  There were some unforeseeable mechanical issues that arose and she handled them in an admirable manner.  She did a wonderful job of communicating and making sure we were taken care of and happy.

The apartment is in a quaint older home in a quiet neighborhood.  It is well laid out and comfortable.  The kitchen is spacious and well stocked.  It'd be easy to save some money by cooking in if you wanted.   The living area is large and comfortably furnished.  The TV is small relative to the room size but that's OK.  We didn't watch it anyway.  The single bathroom is enormous and includes a washer and dryer.  The water pressure is a bit lower than I'm used to but the shower works fine.  The two bedrooms are comfortable.  The master has a queen size bed and is a suite.  The second room has a double bed.  Both have good closet space and are cooled with window AC units.  The smaller room cools better due to its size.

The apartment is on the top floor of the house.  If you're used to sea level conditions, climbing the stairs carrying a heavy suitcase can be a bit of a challenge!  the air really is thinner in Denver!   

There are permanent residents in the building.  They are friendly and quiet.  The downstairs owner is trying to get his grass to grow so please help by staying on the sidewalks!

There is a private parking garage in the back of the lot.  It's a bit small but our rented Nissan Sentra fit fine.  You do have to walk through the backyard to get there but that's not a problem at all.  DON'T forget to leave the remote when you leave!!!  There is also on street parking but it can be limited.  There are several music venues nearby and concertgoers often take up all the spaces.  Also, be aware that there is a two hour time limit from 8-6 during the week.  

The apartment is about 1.5 miles from the center of downtown.  We didn't use public transportation but it looked like lots of buses were running close by.  It's about 30 minutes to/from the airport.

All in all we had a great time in Denver and Emma's hospitality made it even better.  I highly recommend this apartment."

If you have Migraine Disease I would reach out before your stay and ask if they can remove the air fresheners. They are not overwhelming, and if it is a trigger for you it is good to know."
238162,35464927,484410031,2019-07-08,233042260,Renee,"Everything was great! Parking was easy, the location is perfect. We were far enough from crowded downtown but close enough that everything was only a few minutes drive. I can’t say enough good things about our visit. One of the cleanest places we have stayed at."

Shower head was an underrated bonus, especially after a long day of hiking. Overall just a great space and we really enjoyed our stay!"
57548,8941796,214848495,2017-11-26,48210614,Carmence,"Chris's guesthouse was a perfect place for my sister and me to spend the long weekend in Denver. The location is very convenient, just a 5-10 minute drive to downtown Denver area and the freeway if you want to explore other parts of Colorado. The space itself is cozy and warm, and had everything we needed. We didn't meet Chris, but he was a pleasure to communicate with. He responded quickly and helped make our visit to Denver a great one!"
216711,29480284,402801587,2019-01-19,163347380,Delia,This place is SUCH a gem! Absolutely beautiful home - you can tell Sydney really cares a lot and is very thoughtful about curating a welcoming and comfortable space for herself and her guests. Super speedy communicator and very available and approachable for any questions or concerns. She was so friendly and made me feel right at home! Would definitely stay here again if I'm ever back in Denver!
158185,21368214,224613737,2018-01-03,59345257,Jaclyn,"This place is amazing. It is a super cool house at an amazing location. I'm torn because it was a dream house, but getting my reservation changed was a nightmare. 

While the host always responded in a timely manner, getting the whole trip set up was stressful and frustrating. I must have said to the host that I wanted to check in on the 3rd at least 3 times the month before the reservation and when I confirmed with the host one last time the night before check-in, he said he had me for the second. Then when he offered to give me a night for $50 I accepted. Except it wasn't $50, it was $111 and that didn't include the taxes and fees. Long story short, the place is great, but don't try to change your reservation at all because you will want to pull all of your hair out."
106361,15583685,234086339,2018-02-11,172408284,Steven,First time using Airbnb and it was perfect Great location great and the unit was perfect and clean.

Marcie kindly sent directions  prior to our arrival as the entrance is slightly off the main street. On arrival she met us with a wonderfully warm greeting and had even put snacks and local beer in the fridge to welcome us.  

Sadly we had to  cancel our vacation due to a family bereavement however we will most definitely return to Denver and to Marcie's "

We spent some time checking out the local eats and found everything and then some. Awesome burgers, tacos, and authentic pastries near by. The space was clean, trendy, and organized. We felt like we had all the supplies we needed to make coffee, clean up, do laundry, or relax. We definitely enjoyed our stay and will come back when given the chance. I would highly recommend this to any group of 2-4 looking for a weekend get away. "

Not to mention how good of a cook Tonya is, from breakfast to goodies it was all SOO GOOD!

161891,21726072,425045842,2019-03-17,44792634,Ryan,"This place is a gem! Everything about Joe’s place is great. The price, neighborhood, cleanliness, attention to detail, and responsiveness are second to none. It has everything you need. Joe goes above and beyond to make you feel right at home. The place is immaculate and has every amenity you could ever need. The location is impossible to beat as well. It is situated off a quiet street in the RiNo neighborhood and is just steps away from great restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. Next time in town I am hoping I have the chance to rent Joe’s place again."

She left me a snow scraper when reports of snow where coming and her place is a cute and comfy as they come. It’s perfect for the single traveler like myself to be cozy and completely taken care of. This little space has everything you need and she makes sure you have the little things one may forget along their travels. I highly recommend her spot."

The location is not that far from downtown. 
You can Uber/Lyft from anywhere. Or take the public transportation (RTD, download the app for a day pass) and take the train and bus around. The bus stop is literally at the end of the street. 
Also a local brewery opened up within walking distance of her house. 
It’s a great stay and I would stay again! :)"

We did not expect the house to be as equipped as it was - so a pleasant surprise! We had bought things in prep from our past Air BnB experiences.  We had our 3 year old and it was perfect for him - complete with kids cups, plates etc! Awesome location. If we are ever in a Denver again this is our first choice!"

It is easy to walk to various places (the park, grocery stores, restaurants, and Esquire movie theater). We visited Denver without a car and were able to walk, take public transit, or Lyft/Uber to a lot of different places as we explored the city for our first time.  Mark and Dan were great hosts.  The space is super clean and comfortable.  The dvds & popcorn were a nice touch."

My coworker and I rented the condo after seeing that it was within a block of the Curtis Hotel, where we were attending a conference.

Extra towels, soaps, toothbrushes, coffee, candy, nice bed linens and pillows, nice lighting, even pens and paper clips and paper in the desk, and more. I asked if there was a toaster and he only had a toaster oven ... so he went an got one. Highly recommend the place. Heck, there is even a Karaoke machine and pin-ball machines. His dogs are great, too. "

There is a lot to do in the area and it is easy to get out of town if you are looking to go hiking or other various activities outside the city.  The pictures and information online are accurate, the check-in process was simple and well documented, and the hosts were responsive.  Great experience overall."
227806,32160254,464903443,2019-06-06,229321053,Erica,Perfect house for three couples or a family of 6-7. Rooms are spacious and a beautiful park across the street from the house.

The dedicated covered parking spot in the garage and plentiful visitor parking is unheard of in Cap Hill.  My 2 year old daughter loved the indoor pool.

The house is in a centralized location and everything was extremely clean.  Our stay was very comfortable and Pamela is an extraordinarily nice person.  After our event the group was pretty tired and the back patio was the perfect place to enjoy a few choice beverages and great atmosphere. I certainly plan on staying here again with any future trips to Denver. Just a lovely experience.

189479,24751956,287908651,2018-07-08,125845914,Lee,"This was an excellent place for us to stay.  We were coming home from Central Europe  and our flight home would not leave until early the next morning.  Raffie's home was close to the airport, enabling us to get in late and out early.  Beyond the convenience factor, Raffie's home was a very comfortable and a great place to stay.  We had a large bedroom and private bath and were able to make coffee in the room before our early morning departure.  The home is on a lake, so I imagine it would have been nice to be there for a longer period of time.  Raffie was accommodating and a gracious hostess."
125553,17640065,289101402,2018-07-11,125446988,Sameer,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.

108721,15807058,227367403,2018-01-14,110622382,Robert,"Loved the unit and the location. I enjoyed being close to restaurants, shopping, etc. Parking was an issue. The street was very parked up on Saturday night and the assigned spot in back was there but not accessible due to the fact people had parked past their spots and took up the space where I was not able to utilize the assigned spot. Very frustrating! Also, if you’re a light sleeper or a stickler for noise, it is a little loud with the neighbors, but the place/stay was great other than those two main issues."

105606,15509056,134512490,2017-02-27,117188722,Anna,"This is a perfect place for one or two people to stay. I was in Denver for training and specifically chose it because it was in walking distance of the place I was training. It is such a cute place, I love the art work and the furnishings. The couch and bed are comfy. The TV is great. The shower is hot and strong and I like the fact that the bathroom is stocked with shampoo, soap, trial size body lotion, tooth brushes and toothpaste. It has a full kitchen with dishes, glasses, silverware and pans and the fact that it is within walking distance from Whole Foods is great. The supply of coffee for the coffee maker was a nice touch. I highly recommend this place!"

There was a snow storm the night I arrived and I was able to stay in for the day and cook food in the kitchen. The apartment was very warm and cozy. Shannon's boyfriend also gave me some tips about the city and the area. 
156974,21242678,496538209,2019-07-27,37890483,Michael,"Great place to stay for a Colorado visit.  Our family took a short drive every morning to hike, run, and mountain bike.  

For eating and nightlife you can hit countless places without walking more than 5 minutes.  There are coffee houses, bakeries, breweries, restaurants, ice cream and more close by.

We enjoyed the two decks, grill, and full kitchen as well.  Highly recommend."

We were pleasantly surprised to learn that there was a supermarket across from us, and a very large liquor store about two blocks away. 7-11 which is open 24 hours was also a block away. The location felt safe, and the apartment had everything we needed for our stay. "

111430,16066443,268075859,2018-05-23,64965997,Kristi,Such a great value- really great location and for a great price. Check in was very convenient- we drove in late but everything worked perfectly and would definitely stay here again.
152304,21007311,562347454,2019-11-10,72488080,Bre,Very sweet hosts and adorable place! Close to everything and the neighborhood is quiet. Will highly consider staying here again
88435,13624842,326638743,2018-09-22,102396156,Angela,"If you're planning on eating/drinking up and down Larimer, this is the place to stay. Super conveniently located. Host put together a whole binder with menus/recommendations for food, which I thought was going the extra mile. One thing to note, you can and will hear everything from upstairs. Definitely not quiet, but if you're used to city/apartment living it's fine."
153253,21030308,243942274,2018-03-17,137565905,Veeral,"Great apartment, comfortable and a quick drive from most Denver spots"
118349,16857174,147002332,2017-04-24,7967744,Mary,"Rodney's place is PERFECT! If you're in town with a friend or significant other, it's the best place to stay. My friend and I went there for a long weekend and everything was walkable from Rodney's place. And if we didn't want to walk, the most we paid for a Lyft/Uber was $3. Really clean place! Great value. Thanks, Rodney!!"
212022,28742074,472894514,2019-06-20,122027252,Alex,Paul was a great host. Very responsive and accommodating. Home is a quick ride to downtown.
62612,9512789,211314586,2017-11-12,130657391,Barbara,"Mark's place is unique - in a great way. Decor is modern eclectic, with beautiful hardwood floors, comfortable and stylish furniture, and decked out with many electronic features that add comfort and ease. The kitchen is well-stocked with everything needed to prepare meals easily. The living room features a gas fireplace. 
Mark is a great host - he left us clear explicit directions for using his place, and even a gift box with goodies. Then he checked in on us mid-stay via email and otherwise left it up to us to connect with him. 
One thing to be prepared for - it is a spacious two-bedroom place - and the closets in the master suite are locked, as owners' property is stored there. It was fine for us because no one was using the second bedroom and we used that closet. If both bedrooms are used, closet space may be an issue.
Overall, we'd recommend Mark's place and we'd stay again if in Denver."
33950,5394822,286205850,2018-07-05,45528125,Katie,"Absolutely adorable space, perfect for a bigger party (we were a party of 6).  Andy is such a gracious and generous host. Definitely earns the title ""Comfy""! :)"
137730,19391528,338160488,2018-10-18,76387581,Rob,"I'd highly recommend staying at Sarah's home. She was very friendly on my arrival, her home is in a fantastic location and the bed was extremely comfortable."
203911,27266369,309717799,2018-08-18,28595398,Rudy,"Jessica’s place was exactly as advertised. Communication was responsive, neighborhood was great, and the apartment was spotless. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone."
178807,23521683,459799905,2019-05-27,175346712,Evan,A great house in a great location! We couldn’t have asked for anything better.
173667,22942295,292688827,2018-07-18,199362561,James,"it was our first time using Airbnb was better than I expected and it fit our needs although we didn't spend much time at the place and Thomas was always quick to respond and having a parking spot just out the door was nice, and check in was easy it was close to downtown and a short Lyft ride to red rocks, overall it was a great stay "
8824,875596,475775553,2019-06-24,267367222,Geneva,"It’s great, the space is small but perfect for a couple day stay. We enjoyed our time there and the host was wonderful always asking if we were comfortable"
130206,18410407,352827228,2018-11-25,173255371,Beth,This is a fabulous place to stay for a large group. Very clean and nice modern space. Hosts are very good at communication and make you feel like they are glad to host you. Security is good. Awesome location fr enjoying Denver.
159561,21516952,469447738,2019-06-14,109365985,Daniela,My stay is always great!
80042,12915068,162187961,2017-06-19,132448378,Jan,"Lovely home in a beautiful neighborhood. Walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants and a park. The room was spacious with a private bath. Bed was comfortable. Leanne was great communicating every thing."
47894,7663335,468997497,2019-06-13,117660927,Jake,Really enjoyed the stay. Great location to be in. Would recommend
66000,10015153,238434532,2018-02-25,23542298,Lex,"I definitely got the best value for my money by staying at Megan’s. Her place is incredibly close Broadway which is bustling with nightlife activity. While I never got the pleasure of meeting Megan while I was staying here, my partner and I enjoyed our stay. I didn’t originally realize that there is only a twin bed, so I would highly recommend asking for the air mattress (something I didn’t realize was available until after I reread the location description after my trip) if you’d like to share a bed with a significant other. All in all, I appreciated having an affordable place to stay close to Denver and within walking distance of things to do."
177765,23388648,435542209,2019-04-10,61016491,Christian,"Ideal location, clean, stylish little apartment which is quiet and has a terrific mattress, bathroom, and other amenities. Quick and clear communications with the owner. It's walking distance to some great bars and restaurants for all hours of the day."
187887,24520787,538449663,2019-09-29,16067734,Katie,Markus was super helpful in helping us out when we got locked out of the unit and very responsive when we were short a towel. It is very helpful that he lives onsite and communicates quickly. The location is a short walk to Larimer St with access to great restaurants and breweries. Recommend for sure!
13513,1900638,56612955,2015-12-15,49167379,Tracey,"Wonderful, accommodating, inviting. HOME! 
Barbara and her daughter welcomed me when I arrived.  I saw only her daughter (& puppy) during my three day stay until I checked out when I saw Barbara and her son.
Full use of the kitchen including a large fridge, & stove. Snacks galore provided! Space to store your groceries.
Master bdrm more than adequate w/comfortable bed, chair/stool, desk. House is a little chilly, but throw blanket available and heating pad was sweet! I keep my house the same way. 
Bath has everything you'd need if you don't bring your own. Big thick towels you won't find in hotel. :) 
Sm, convenient coffee pot in bath area. 
Nice neighborhood. Easy to navigate. DU and many restaurants within 20-30 min walk or 5-10 min drive.
Super reasonable house rules. One I noticed but was not a problem for me; guest should be aware Barbara prefers they not invite their guests home."
195030,25586560,327376512,2018-09-23,127233022,Grace,"A great find in the heart of Denver! Close to bronco stadium and a 5 min drive to DT to all breweries , shopping restaurants and nightlife. Crystals and Jeff’s Airbnb was a great fit and perfect for us! The pictures are exactly of what the apartment offered! 

Thanks again !"
82822,13081152,82825796,2016-06-29,45463171,Mariha,"This was our first time using Airbnb and we could not have asked for a better experience. Mitch was such a great host. In the trip planning process Mitch was very responsive to our questions and that trend continued as we arrived. 
We had an early morning arrival and Mitch was up early to let us in and even had a fresh pot of coffee started for us!
As soon as we arrived he welcomed us with a tour of his beautiful home, he even had a packet of information for traveling around the city and places to explore. 
The second night of our stay we all happened to be home at the same time so we got to spend some time with Mitch and his girl friend which was fun!
Our final night in Denver we headed up to the Red Rocks Amphitheater which was a once in a lifetime experience!!!! That day however there was a big ice storm and Mitch went out of his way to call us to make sure we were okay in the storm. 
Overall we had an amazing time and could not have asked for a better host or a better first experience with Airbnb. Thank you Mitch.... we hope to see you the next time we are back in Denver!"
1737,59631,45797916,2015-09-06,22611207,Abby,"Julie's place was great! Spacious, sunny, and very comfortable. I stayed with my husband and two friends and it was the perfect size for us (and could have fit a few more!). We did have a rental car and found ourselves driving to most places, but we didn't have a lot of time to explore, so we probably could have found some walk-able attractions as well. Julie was very responsive and helpful throughout the whole process. Definitely would stay again!"
214008,29130386,504408988,2019-08-07,55735118,Daniel,Great hosts!

Sparkling clean house.  The name says it all, The Happy Home.  We will be back!"
176271,23257443,459786394,2019-05-27,97177387,Bree,"Sarsha was helpful, responsive and easy to work with! The house was great for our large group. The kitchen was filled with everything we needed to cook so that we could enjoy a home cooked meal on the beautiful patio and backyard! It’s a great spot, close to cool restaurants and local go-to spots. Would definitely recommend!!"
173513,22928612,303166209,2018-08-06,10073264,Colleen,"Tim's treehouse is close to many great breakfast, lunch, and dinner spots. It's also a stone throw from Central Park where there are many events, the zoo, and other Denver hubs. The treehouse is a nice place to relax for one or two guests. Make sure you're comfortable with your partner if you're traveling in pairs as it is close quarters in terms of the bathroom and shower. We enjoyed meeting Tim, his wife, and their dog Larry, and were even greeted with some delicious banana bread. Many thanks!!"
123697,17405963,226844487,2018-01-12,120036863,Veronika,We had a great stay! Thanks Brant to make us feel like being at home. Highly recommended!
93414,13993831,201697820,2017-10-08,77370764,Monica,"My mom and I stayed with Candice while visiting my sister who attends Regis University. Our experience was fantastic! Candice made sure we had everything we needed and even kept us occupied with a puzzle while my sister was in class. Regis is literally right down the street so the location was super convenient. Honestly, the entire experience was just great and we look forward to having us or other friends and family stay there again soon :)"
49329,7912052,153271966,2017-05-20,121594909,Tyler,The hosts were wonderfully friendly. Aki was even willing to take us to and from the nearby transit station so that we could use the light rail to get around. We would definitely stay here again.

124454,17530389,468122180,2019-06-11,74471265,Ashley,Marcus's place was great. It was close to downtown and in a cute neighborhood. The place was clean and comfy. The kitchen had everything we needed to make our own meals. The communication was great!
113417,16216415,517633364,2019-08-25,14899718,Derek,"Kristen’s home was truly a perfect Airbnb. It was clean, spot on with pictures and descriptions. The house is very updated with new trends in design yet keeping it feeling like home. The west room bedroom had a huge king bed, comfortable mattress topper, a fan that really moved the air, and an air conditioning unit in the window. There were snacks and water to keep you happy and quenched during your stay. The house was open to the guests and the patio had many different spots to enjoy the yard. 
Kristen is a true host, and is very approachable and enjoys talking and giving local suggestions. 
I know that if I come back to Denver I will be sure to stay here again without any hesitation. The neighborhood is great and the stay is even better. 
Thanks Kristen!!!"

165679,21993592,218580047,2017-12-13,162151808,Thomas,Great place!  Apartment was clean and comfortable.  Vince quickly responded to all of our questions.  Very close to Union Station and many options for food and drink.  Lots of construction going on in the area which wasn't a big deal.  Shower had low water pressure - still worked fine but a minor inconvenience.  Would definitely stay there again.
195728,25733062,520022616,2019-08-29,17713764,John,"Brandon and Jean's space was perfect for our family's visit to Denver.  Their place was clean and comfortable and located in a wonderful walkable neighborhood. Their communication was clear and quick, and I would definitely book with them again the next time I'm in Denver."

125337,17634528,165373586,2017-07-01,136364923,Nancy,We loved this place. The space available is very nice. Nice to have a coffee in the morning and the fridge had a couple of beers so we could have a tasty cold one before heading to the nearby store after we arrived. The neighborhood is beautiful. We walked to the downtown easily. There are a couple of little craft brew pubs in the neighborhood. A lot of nearby restaurants. Highly recommended!

29033,4388297,45203429,2015-08-31,36896393,Emily,"Carolyn was gone for the first night that my friend and I stayed at her apartment, but she was still an awesome host from afar! She had everything set up for us when we got there, was very welcoming and communicative, and made sure we had everything we needed. Her apartment was awesome and in a great location in the city. My only regret was that we didn't really get to meet beyond a quick hello as she went to work in the morning! I would definitely recommend staying with Carolyn :)"
229963,32746862,556886366,2019-10-30,4796437,Salvador,"Such a great home! Loved it’s close proximity to so many shops, restaurants and bars! Everything was within short walking distance or a quick Uber to downtown. 

The owners were quick to respond to any questions/concerns we had. I would absolutely recommend this home to anyone! Great for groups!"
14104,1959836,163150854,2017-06-23,86750275,Courtney,Anne's place is beautifully decorated and pleasant to be in. Her roommates room is right next to the room which makes it a bit awkward to return late. 
25633,4067759,441169729,2019-04-21,197172720,Will,"Perfect for a quieter getaway from the busy areas of Denver, but still really conveniently located. Pick this place if you want a laid back place in a walkable area."
239241,35971684,500705481,2019-08-02,49664523,Chuqi,"A nice home in a nice neighborhood, with everything you will need as a guest! Easy to check in, doors all have locks, you also get all the privacy you want. The room is equipped with a mini fridge and a microwave, a recliner, a tv and a desk/sitting area. Very short ride to and from the airport, ideal for one to crush for the night. Read the instructions and it tells you everything you need to know to get around in the home."
153754,21043300,485857796,2019-07-11,144431832,Joanne,"Great, quiet location with easy access to Sloan’s Lake and area restaurants. Lovely fenced-in yard. House has good space that allowed our party of four to spread out, as well as hang out together in common areas. Many nice touches, such as board games, Apple TV in the master bedroom downstairs, big washer/dryer, and a kitchen with good counter space and plenty of appliances, cookware, and tableware. Beds were comfortable. There were some issues with cleanliness, which I reported separately to David in a post-departure message; hopefully, he will take care going forward. David was very responsive before and during our stay."

15223,2139342,22185286,2014-11-01,6213132,Daniel,"This location is on a busy road...if you are very sensitive about noise this may bother you but this was a very minimal issue for us. The property is surrounded by a privacy wall and the road is busy during rush hour periods only. At night, it was fairly quiet. I expected parking to be a hassle but it was super easy and convenient.

Regarding the space itself, it exceeded our expectations. The entire place was very nice and much larger than we were expecting. There are 2 generous sized bedrooms, a large living room and a decent sized kitchen. It really had more than we needed. There is also a very nice courtyard for sitting outside.

I was really impressed with the space. 

Location wise, it was very convenient location for getting around Denver. Grocery, restaurants etc are all close by.

if you have a family, the layout of the space is such that you don't need to be on top of each other. For example if adults wanted to stay up after kids went to bed, the bedrooms are down a long l shape hall so the kids probably won't hear a thing."
17636,2467260,464056643,2019-06-04,77008396,Serena,This place offered a great location and great price for what we needed. Ryan was very helpful and ready to offer suggestions to local attractions.

Kevin made the check in process easy and left a thorough guide with information about the place and the neighborhood. The location is perfect, just a short walk from downtown. Pedicabs are also a good option for getting around if you've been walking all day. My favorite part about this place is the balcony, perfect spot to catch some sun on a nice day with great views of the city and Rocky Mountain sunsets!"

The living space has a modern, open design with fantastic amenities, and plenty of room for everyone. The home is extremely well-maintained in a great location, with easy access to many exceptional local shops and cafes within short walking distance. I highly recommend this home to parties of 4-6 who want a clean, quiet, centrally-located property to enjoy the beautiful city of Denver."

The loft is beautiful, bright, and thoughtfully decorated with wonderful little touches around the apartment, including a list of local recommendations. Kim and Marke were responsive and helpful hosts. We look forward to hopefully returning to Denver and their AirBnb again!"

Super cute spot and that patio was to die for. We really, really liked staying there. I love Denver and can see myself coming back (Bassnectar will be there again next June so  I'll want to stay there again. Wonder how far out we can book....?). Anyway, thank you so much for creating a very comfortable, stylish and oh so convenient spot to lay our heads. Five stars all the way!"

We especially liked the large kitchen space, wireless speakers, TV with built in Netflix, etc.

Street parking was a challenge at times, but we made due. It was a quick Uber ride to most Denver destinations, and a 4 minute walk to Starbucks and Trader Joes. 

I recommend this for large groups staying in the Denver area."

48574,7843605,47332163,2015-09-17,33001672,Colin,Everything was just as described and pictured! Very very clean! The extra little goodie bag of snacks and coffee was sweet little unexpected bonus! The hosts were incredibly accommodating to my late check in (due to a late flight). This was my first time using AirBnB so I didn't know what to expect. But I will certainly say now it will not be my last. Thanks Cynthia!

Robin is an incredible host and her place is welcoming and in a great location. I would recommend it to anyone."

230621,32959758,522785523,2019-09-02,175933811,Robert,"My $350 room Labor Day weekend was the first bad AirBnb experience I’ve had. After getting confirmation from the “host” that the room was ready, 2 hours later during check in there were no sheets on the bed, a ladder was in the living room and a couch was in the middle of being moved out. The “host” was obviously not communicating with the housekeeping and it caused my girlfriend and I to miss out on reservations that night. They ended up moving us to a room that smelled of cigarettes. We were very acceptive of the poor accommodations and then were accused of stealing the next day. For such a marked up price, they completely fell through and the “host” didn’t take blame for their mistakes at all. In sum, this is a property management group with very poor management and makes AirBnb look bad. I will definitely look into the “host” more for my future AirBnb’s."

34978,5508545,218748646,2017-12-14,109144260,Sonali,"Reasonable value for the price, which was low overall for the Denver area.  It is a basement apartment in an older duplex with older furnishings, and you get what you pay for.  We stayed here specifically because we travel with two large dogs, who were welcomed.  Fenced backyard was a nice feature, but latch on front gate is not all that secure and if you plan to leave an escape artist in the yard, he may wiggle the latch open pretty easily.  The host was friendly, and the unit was overall clean.  Pro: low cost for place that allows dogs.  Con: very squeaky and creaking floors above can make a remarkable amount of noise when people are upstairs.  The floors are also fairly thin, so conversations / TV are easily heard from upstairs even at low volume.  As a basement apartment, the windows are very small and none are south-facing so there is almost no natural light.  No thermostat in the basement so heating was erratic (host provides space heaters and fans, and windows can be cracked open). 
This unit is not for very light sleepers due to noise from the floors."
197744,26131284,404595573,2019-01-24,26215859,Allie,"A wonderful choice for many reasons — the proximity to RiNo and downtown made it extremely easy to explore Denver, the Curtis Park Club is beautifully designed and still mega comfortable, the quiet quarters and cozy fireplace made it near impossible to leave our room when we woke up to snow that morning. Will definitely be recommending to my friends and fellow travelers!"
169942,22494945,531934548,2019-09-18,149990812,Courtney,"My boyfriend and I had a nice time in Denver and at the unit. The space was a lot larger than expected. There were every amenities in the bathroom and kitchen that one would need, this isn’t true of all Airbnb’s. 

The area would have been easy to get around to. Very close to the zoo, botanical gardens, and the museum of natural history. We did have a car since we did a bit of hiking.

Tina left us fresh flowers which was a great touch. The dogs were super nice and fun to play with. 

If you are over 6 feet just know it is a basement unit so the ceilings are a bit short. My boyfriend is 6’5 and had to duck in a couple of areas. 

All in all a great unit and a great bang for you’re buck."

It is very dangerous because of not wanting to leave the bed!!!!  It is in a nice part of town where there are many hip restaurants and local grocery stores.  It was a small bike ride to Union Station, and has B Bikes on the corner.  There is also one of the short term rent-a-car stations on the block if you wanted to drive anywhere.  Very impressed by this Airbnb."

There was also a helpful reference book with suggested places to eat and go out. The neighborhood is being revitalized and it was well lit and felt safe the entire length of our stay. There is a beautiful garden on the patio that provides a wonderful ambience. The urban farmhouse is conveniently located close to downtown about a 5-7 dollar Uber ride. There were 4 of us in the house and it worked well being that there are two identical bedrooms with queen sized beds. Staying in this house was the cherry on top of the sundae that is a visit to Denver.  "

The location is perfect--an easy walk to coffee, restaurants, shops, etc. Richard and Kelly were beyond hospitable: they got back to us quickly regarding everything and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and private. We never even met them in person but they made us feel like they were there if we needed it, but left us ultimate privacy as well. If we come back to Denver, we would stay here again in a heartbeat. Both beds were super comfortable, the bathroom is wonderful, and the place truly has everything you need. I HIGHLY recommend. Thank you Richard and Kelly! "

The stay was a very nice renovated basement with lots of space and many amenities (like a washer and dryer that helped after we camped!). I was a little confused with the wording of the listing and thought I would be the only guest in the basement (thinking the shared bathroom was with the host), this wasnt the case as there was another guest, but it still worked out great and lived up to expectations!

Cheryl provided a neat and clean space that was very comfortable during our time there. She was very kind and accomodating with us (and so was her family), and gave us great information about the neighborhood she lives in and about Denver. We also also had the opportunity to engage in great conversation with her and our pups played with each other.

9649,1041934,291863760,2018-07-16,17429985,Devin,"Annette and her team are a big plus to this space. They were quick to try to solve an issues we had during our stay. The home is charming and lovely if you don’t mind something with some miles on it. The claw foot bathtub was my favorite. The location is amazing, we had a nice short walk to a farmers market and also a nice walk to and from the bar down the street. I believe it’s called local 46, it’s a must if you’re visiting the area. The only downsides were the air conditioning had not been on and running until after we got there and even then it still had some trouble. BUT Denver did reach temps over 100 that day and we were doing fine once it was back in the 70’s the next day. Would definitely stay again!"

220106,30312111,511724200,2019-08-17,228212389,Alex,"Kathy’s place is great! I stayed here for 3 months during a summer internship. The location right next to City Park is an easy walk or Uber to nearby bars and restaurants and the park has plenty of paths for running or walking. The space itself is perfect for a working professional new to the area. Not a massive apartment but works just fine for one person. The bedroom is good size and the bathroom lacks counter space but there is plenty of storage underneath the sink and behind the mirror.  The kitchen is good size as well and provides some cookware. The neighborhood is very quiet but accessible to downtown and nearby Safeway and restaurants. Getting around with a car is no problem at all, parking is always available on the street outside the apartment. Driving to nearby Boulder, Golden, or the mountains is very easy to get to from Kathy’s place.  Overall, I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone!"

Maura is an amazing human being and has a great energy. She made my stay so comfortable that it felt like staying at my best friend's place, and the house has so much character and style that it feels as if you are in an art exhibition. Jack is the coolest and sweetest dog as well! Her house location was perfect to enjoy Denver at it's fullest and all the different amenities the city and surrounding areas have to offer. Maura's recommendations about what to do in the city where more than helpful, and her Deliciousness jams are out of this world! 10/10 :-)"

Everything was clean, shower hot and good. Hairdryer in bathroom dresser most welcome. Breakfast was good. 

Only slight niggle was the trains sounding their arrival at every signal crossing which could be heard on their approach. But to be honest we were so tired we slept anyway"

You’re 15-20 minutes away from Denver. House is simple and exactly as advertised. My family of four and father-in-law stayed here and were super comfortable. Anything you need, Jerry is quick to respond."

I really think this option was perfect for my girlfriend and me and I would love to stay here on our trip later this year. One thing I would improve is the internet quality. I did make the decision to g with this listing because it had internet, but it was seriously lacking; that would be the one factor to deter me from this listing in the future. "

Thanks David for a fantastic weekend, we'll be back! "
29693,4545539,473486091,2019-06-21,27610524,Paul,"We stayed at Tyler's place for a couple of nights to see a show and shop in Denver.  The show was downtown at the Paramount but the midweek hotel prices were outrageous.  Tyler's place was within ~2 miles of downtown and provided a nice alternative at half of the price.  I hadn't stayed in the ""Baker"" neighborhood before, but it was eclectic and nice.  Within a couple of blocks was Broadway, a major thoroughfare, with multiple pubs, restaurants, shops with a few blocks walk.  We could easily find breakfast and dinner nearby.  The apartment is nice and the decor is contemporary.  It's a basement apartment that was outfitted with everything that you'd need for a stay.  They had off-street parking for us as well.  We'd certainly stay there again and recommend it to everyone as well."

They were quick to respond to questions before we booked and very responsive while we were staying there.  The house was super clean and had everything that we needed for a week long stay with our kids.  Very convenient to major roads and highways, but a quiet enough neighborhood to go for a run in the morning or walk the kids down to the park to play in the afternoon.  This was a great find and we would definitely stay there again if ever back in the Denver area.  (PS - As mentioned in a previous comment, make sure that you ignore the lockbox on the front storm door/gate and use the entry code on the deadbolt on the front door.)"

You can expect privacy even if the room doesn't have a door (some blinds are propped up perfectly to provide privacy) Gina was incredibly kind and helpful throughout the entire stay, too. We'd love to stay with her again whenever we make our way down here!"
59499,9135545,142097798,2017-04-06,4105947,Josh,A little further from downtown Denver but not by too much. Everyone who stayed there was friendly and reminded me of a hostel.

She made check in and out a breeze which is great if you don't have concrete times for getting into town. Her place is a bit far from down town if you plan to spend most of your time there keep in that in mind. The bus system can be questionable due to traffic. Expect around 20-25 for a uber ride if you are only planning to go downtown for a day or maybe 2. That is, if you dont rent a car. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I would recommend Jessica's home to anyone!"

We were in Denver for my mom’s surgery, and they made an exhausting, difficult trip much more pleasant than I thought it would be! They provided toys for our daughter and tips on places my husband could take her to play while I was at the hospital. The bedroom, living area, and bathroom were very clean, and we had an abundance of clean pillows, blankets, and towels. We noticed very little noise from upstairs, and it was a very peaceful place to return to after a few days of chaos! The house was also close to everything we needed, including restaurants, basic shopping (Walmart/groceries), and parks. We had an excellent stay!"

It is in a fantastic neighborhood and close to walk for restaurants and the botanical gardens, along with quick drive to everywhere in the city.

Four of my family members stayed in Denver for Thanksgiving week at Kari’s because it was only a couple of blocks away from my daughter’s house where we were celebrating the holiday. Kari’s family is obviously musical and so is ours...we entertained ourselves on her upright piano, guitar, and maracas! There is plenty of room for everyone to congregate in the open-plan living/dining/kitchen area, but there are also two other hangout areas so people could have a little privacy when needed. One minor issue-one of our family is sensitive to odors and Kari has a gorgeous kitchen that had residual cooking odors. It didn’t bother anyone else, so that member decided to stay at my daughter’s during the week."

Wir, eine Familie mit zwei Kindern (4 und 10 Monate), haben uns bei Caroline sehr wohl gefühlt! Der Check-in und -out lief problemlos und wir haben uns schnell eingelebt. Mit der Buslinie 16, die gleich um die Ecke hält, war man sehr schnell im Zentrum der Stadt. Aber man konnte auch mit dem Auto sehr fix in die Natur fahren, wie etwa zu den Red Rocks oder dem Lookout Mountain. 
Die Nachbarschaft war sehr ruhig und es gab rundherum gute Essensmöglichkeiten und nur etwa fünf Autominuten entfernt gab es auch ein Walmart Supercenter.
Die Küche war mit allem ausgestattet was man im Alltag so zum Kochen, Backen und Essen braucht. 
Alles in allem sehr zu empfehlen!!!!"

On the first day, through no fault of the owner, the neighbors were working on something in their front yard, the second day a man came by in the morning to mow the lawn and do some construction on the fence in the backyard. The owner was very polite and warned us about the construction. All in all it was a very pleasurable stay, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in the Denver area. Incredible host, no nonsense, full disclosure on everything. Very professional. "
9004,915016,129971380,2017-02-03,103048734,Bunny,"My mom and I stayed at Tim and Cindy's place for about a month, and it had everything we could have needed! The kitchen is well-equipped, the washer and dryer are so convenient, and the space itself is lovely and very comfortable. It's located in such a great neighborhood as well-- the houses are beautiful and a Whole Foods is very close by. We ended up being able to walk to a lot of places! Otherwise we could easily use Uber or rent a car cheaply over the weekend. Not to mention Tim and Cindy are the greatest hosts we could have asked for-- so kind, helpful, and all around just wonderful people. Staying here is what made this month-long Denver trip such a pleasant one. I would definitely not hesitate to stay here again if the opportunity for another trip presented itself."

Even though there were a lot of instructions, it was fairly easy to find and there's a good amount of curbside parking. Just beware of the street sweeping signs. If you need a place to sleep while in town on business this place will do you well. It's got a comfy bed, wifi, Netflix and even some groceries that the host leaves for you. Pretty nice.

If you are into running; you can head right down 30th and run to a park about a mile away. My only feedback on the location is that it is close to most things in downtown Denver, but I would not recommend walking around the area at night."
55260,8680784,304041061,2018-08-08,40241321,Terry,Convenient to downtown and comfortable. Nice neighborhood architecture and front yard gardens.

204123,27271600,327921502,2018-09-24,40629969,Andrew,"This was the last Airbnb we stayed in on our two week roadtrip - and it was easily one of our favourites! 

The space is clean, stylish and has everything you need! We loved the patio area and enjoyed breakfast out there in the sunshine before exploring the city.

The city centre is just a very short and inexpensive Uber ride away. Red Rocks was also just a 15min drive away.

We can not recommend this place enough and we would definitely stay again."

242110,37561342,567458882,2019-11-22,300772139,Michael,This was a great option over staying in town for a convention.  The cost of the week was less that a night in a hotel and much more relaxing.  Uber/Lyft is ~$10.00 to the convention center but there is also a bus stop right around the corner.  The wifi was good; I did several video-conferences with no issues as all.  This was my first AirBnB experience.  I hope they are all this good.
120311,17071557,138817191,2017-03-21,118117794,Krista,"This place was just as described. It is a little noisy at night from Colorado Blvd being right there, but there is one of those sleep sound things that helps with the noise."

98454,14772610,530433683,2019-09-15,119259813,Betsy,"This place is at a great location and very affordable! It is in a basement and clearly a bit unfinished (e.g., bathroom door does not close all of the way). The kuerig does not work.  Also my boyfriend could not stand up in the shower because the ceilings were too low. Really though this place cannot be beat for the price it is at! Both hosts were very accommodating!"

Mercedes took the time to walk us through, show all the amenities, and gave us the history of the home. We had 10 people stay very comfortably here. Joshua was very responsive and helpful our entire stay! The location is perfect to get downtown or anywhere in the metro area. 10/10 recommendation!"

The location couldn't be any better. Lauren is so kind and easy going. Her cat Squash is the best co-host a gal could ask for. Her 420 friendly supply is outta sight. Lauren makes sure you have everything you need to enjoy Denver including the best food suggestions. Anytime I travel to Denver, I will be    a repeat offender with Lauren."

My husband was quite at home (nicer than our home) hanging out there while I was at a conference. There were great amenities in the kitchen and bath and the check-in was easy for our late arrival. Christine was a great host, checking in the day after we arrived to be sure we had all we needed. I highly recommend this place!"

24851,3992779,94930186,2016-08-17,64081646,Candice,"Elizabeth was a great host. She was on top of everything, from recommendations, check-in and check-out and providing small amenities.  Her place is in a great location, only a few blocks away from the park and a few shops. You have the entire basement to yourself. It is a basement apartment, so you will hear people walking around above you (if those kind of things bother you). Overall great stay and would return! "

Very convenient location near the airport, but easily accessible for getting on or off I-70 to go to or come from other areas of Denver. Tiela was a wonderful host and I had an excellent stay.

The house is absolutely wonderful. Beautifully decorated, spacious and clean. The neighborhood is quiet but an easy walk to the lively area.  (Hidden by Airbnb) maps is a must for a day or two as it is easy to get turned around in the neighborhood. No worries here. "
120859,17154609,523909847,2019-09-04,18508827,Jennifer,"We flew out to Denver to celebrate my birthday/honeymoon. Ahmed's place was clean, with a full kitchen to cook in (a must for us when we travel!), in walking distance to a wonderful vegan coffee shop, with parking out front always. He is incredibly thoughtful in creating a space for his guests and his communication is excellent. We had a snafu in booking, and thought we booked the whole place and not just a private room, and Ahmed was able to point us in the right direction with communicating through Airbnb and processing a payment. We are so grateful for Ahmed, his incredible townhouse and the sunset up on the rooftop!"

My flight arrived late, and I liked that I was able to just enter a couple of codes to get in without disturbing her. The house smelled like blueberry muffins which she had so graciously made for us. Inside the room, she has a coffee maker, a mini fridge,  closet, large dresser and a large comfortable bed. She even left water for us, which is key in the high altitude environment. The bathroom was directly across the hall with a combo shower/tub which was very clean and modern. The first morning we lounged on the porch and sipped our coffees slowly, as one should do on vacation. We were greeted by her beautiful Bernese Mountain Dog, who is very well behaved and friendly.  Overall, we had a very pleasant experience."

189287,24746875,350242906,2018-11-18,70696221,Maureen,Zach is an extraordinary host! We were staying in Denver for a conference and needed some boxes mailed to his address. It was a BIG favor to ask him to receive these large boxes and he did so gladly. His apt is cozy and clean- modern and an excellent location if you need to be downtown. The parking was on the street opposite the Airbnb entry- very convenient. A Keirig coffeemaker stocked with  every supply. There is a nice fridge and microwave. No kitchen sink or stove. So think about food that needs to be microwaved or better yet eat out in the town ! We would surely stay again and recommend to anyone who wants to visit Beautiful Denver!

Her apartment is absolutely stunning and was kept completely clean the entire trip. I can't express how grateful I am to have had such an amazing host that made me truly feel like I was at home.

It’s within walking distance of Broadway and all its restaurants, nightspots, and Denver flavor. It is a basement apartment, so if views and sunshine are important, this one is not for you. "
190388,24856267,415882370,2019-02-23,17897175,Tomas,"We had a here at trip. We highly recommend this place. The hot tub is amazing, and the arcade game was fun. Clean and cozy space."
166558,22100613,324139942,2018-09-16,7916853,Amy Ulrich,"This is a fantastic place to stay if you are coming to Denver. The Wash Park area where this is located is very trendy and is just a lovely neighborhood, with coffee shops, Bonnie Brae ice cream shop and local stores all within just a couple short blocks. Extremely convenient to Cherry Creek Mall, DU campus, and downtown, very safe and quiet. Lovely studio apartment and just everything I needed for my 4 night stay. Coffee, fridge, plates, cups, silverware, water, comfortable bed, television, wifi, and a large bathroom with towels and even a robe.  Very easy checkin. Ben provided the code to the keypad while I was on my way to Denver.  I have already recommended this location to another traveler and will definitely stay here again on my next trip."
241986,37458909,511627315,2019-08-17,145021866,Andria,"It was an extremely clean space. It was cleaned daily. I stayed that I was in town for an interview and inquired about an iron. He went out and purchased one. It got quiet hot at night, but we were given access to the air conditioner. 
The WiFi password isn’t given upon check in. I could have asked, but didn’t. 
The major problem I had was that there were 2 small children, including an infant.  There was crying or fussing at night or in the early hours that interrupted sleep. I wish I was informed of this in the description. I still would have booked, but set up my stay a little different. I could have been prepared."

Kate's home is on a quiet residential street, just a few minutes walk to the trendy Highlands central business area with fun shops and restaurants.  Kate was wonderful to work with, going the extra mile to accomodate us on very short notice.  I could have lost myself for days in her artwork."

I had a hard time finding affordable Airbnbs in Denver that are not basements, and I'm so glad I was able to find this cute row house/townhouse. The digital door lock was very convenient and easy to use, no need to carry around keys. Location is great, a very short walk to RiNo. Joe was excellent with communication, checking in with us several times before and during our trip to make sure everything was going smoothly. He was very accommodating, and let us leave our bags for a few hours after we checked out since our flight was late in the afternoon. He also had a ton of recommendations of things to do. One of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed in."

235958,34508362,522835650,2019-09-02,97461094,Brandon,"This was a nice basement spot for us to crash for a night. Just a heads up: you might not want to use the top bunk bed if you don’t have to. The mattress is loud enough that just about any movement could wake up people in the other two beds in the room. Otherwise, it worked well."

85893,13447318,143198885,2017-04-10,106294557,Maddie,"Jessica was really sweet and had lots of suggestions of what to do. The major issue was how hot the room was. I don't think there was A/C and the window was locked shut. there was one ceiling fan but it was incredibly noisy, especially while trying to sleep, and didn't help very much. One issue we had with the shared bathroom was that there was an uncovered cat door from the bathroom to the hosts room, which you could see through and it limited our privacy. The room was a great size for two people, but i wouldn't recommend it for more than that. The last problem we had was a minor one but we were told we would have a full top shelf of the fridge to put our food, but about 2/3's of the shelf was taken up so we couldn't fit everything. Overall, it was a good stay for what we paid."

40249,6488535,54395106,2015-11-19,3174416,Ari,"This apartment is exactly as pictured. Not only is it decorated straight out of a hip Pinterest post, it's super clean and organized.  All appliances are very modern and up to date. Plus, you get the feel of actually being part of the neighborhood instead of feeling like a tourist in a hotel. The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in (really!). There was plenty of parking and a laundry room on site (laundry detergent and cleaning supplies are provided in the apartment). Brandon left us craft beers in the refrigerator, snacks and lots of Denver guide books. Brandon was also super helpful when we asked for ideas on where to go and what to do. Although we didn't meet him, it was good to know he was on premises in case we needed anything. The apartment was very quiet and peaceful. There is a Roku tv with tons of tv apps if you just want some down time watching tv. The neighborhood is amazing. We walked everywhere! Lots of cool shops selling items you don't see everywhere, clothing stores, great vintage stores, bars and coffee shops. We can't wait to come back and stay at Brandon's apartment!! "

Apart from her beautiful home and incredible hospitality, she was very responsive to any questions we asked. She made our stay in Denver substantially better and gave us a great introduction to a great city.

Everything was sparkling clean, each room is so thoughtfully decorated and designed, their kids even left my daughter a super sweet note with some of their favorite snacks ♥️♥️ Not only is everything as gorgeous as it looks in the photos, it’s comfortable and functional too. Aaron and Katelyn are amazing hosts- extremely easy to reach and so accommodating and helpful. I instantly felt at home in their space- it has both lovely personal touches and leaves space for you to settle in at the same time. The location is perfection- 5 minute walk from Snooze, less than 10 minute drive to the natural history museum and zoo. I really can’t get over how intentional everything is in their home- I’m feeling inspired now that I’m back in my own! So grateful to Aaron and Katelyn for opening up their home and allowing us to stay in such a lovely place on what was at times a tough weekend for our family. We were in town to attend a memorial service for a beloved family member, and it was wonderful to have such a great home base to decompress in."

When you arrive you'll find that there's plenty of street parking and the basement private entrance is easy to locate. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures, and was exceptionally clean but my favorite part were the personal touches all over. The guest book and shadow box with recommendations was great. I also loved how Judy and Marty thought of every need and had so many things available, washer/dryer, movies, games, space heater, toiletries, water, snacks etc. The apartment is also super stylish! I loved the shadow box with postcards and the picture of their dog. We were also 5-10 minutes away from everything, making it super convenient to get around. I highly recommend staying here while in Denver!"

My friend and I never had the pleasure of meeting Ryan but everything was set up very nicely. We were able to come and go as we pleased, the instructions in getting the keys, etc., were very easy and helpful, and the location was SO convenient. We were seeing Adele at the Pepsi Center, so an Uber was a measly $7 from the house! I would highly recommend this room to anyone looking for quality, convenience, and comfort!! Thanks Ryan!"

The rooms for AirBnb guests are secure with locks, everything is new and clean, and Monica and John make you feel at home. I really enjoyed the night here, and will come back when I'm in Denver"

116111,16582485,454580140,2019-05-18,53568740,Jacqueline,"Cindy's place is in a fantastic location.  It is so easy to get to from the airport via the train!  You are right near the train station, so bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper, but the sound machine really helps and I kind of liked the background noise.  The garage was easy to navigate since we rented a car to get to Red Rocks.  There are bikes across the street that we used to bike around Denver that were also super convenient.  There were a ton of incredible restaurants in the area that we checked out. We loved our time in Denver and would stay at Cindy's when we come back."

I came into Denver on a Saturday to relax from time off the slopes. I went to dinner with a friend who lives in Colorado Springs & just came back to hang out, low key, casual. I slept so wonderful on the bed & it was all set up sooo well! Thanks again Pete & Carlie!"
